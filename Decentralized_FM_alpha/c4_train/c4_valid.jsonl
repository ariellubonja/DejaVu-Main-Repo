We have successfully been using this approach in bananas since 2002. Our banana agronomy program is now almost considered conventional in this industry with 40% of growers now using Petrik products.\nA biological farming approach results in improvements in many areas. The combination of balanced soil chemistry and applied biology results in improved yields, more consistent quality, better plant health and superior disease resistance.\nWhile we initially adjusted the soil chemistry looking to improve Sigatoka control we did notice a decline in activity of plant parasitic nematodes as well. The same cell wall integrity increases the plants resistance to pathogens attacking the foliage and the roots. While we do not have the same availability of data as for Sigatoka we have no growers using our whole program who are applying any nematicide. Management of the system is robust with most clients utilising monthly soil testing and leaf testing in order to fine tune fertiliser programs.\nFertiliser programs have also reduced the use of nitrogen and phosphorus. In all farms we have reduced nitrogen use by approximately one third while at the same time improving productivity. Phosphorus applications have been eliminated on most farms. Tissue phosphorous levels are now consistently higher under a biology program than they were previously when the farm was under a full phosphorous fertilizer program. This has been documented over time and is supported by university studies. The biological release of potassium, however, is generally much slower as this depends upon the breakdown of the actual clay particles. With a crop such as banana with a high potassium extraction this will never match crop demand. Potassium application requirements have actually increased in many cases as yields have gone up. With potassium it is pretty simple. If you take it away you need to replace it. We do not consider N and P in the same manner, however, as these have much stronger biological relationships and growing also means increased root exudates and a healthier soil which can often increase P and N availability by the actions of the soil biology.\nThere are further, more widespread, implications to sustainable farming in the North Queensland banana industry particularly with regards to run off to the Great Barrier Reef. Using Petrik products can reduce the environmental impact of farming by reducing the usage of nitrogen, pesticides and fungicides. This will help farmers meet the run off targets set by the government for 2018.\nThe mainstay of the banana industry has been Digestor. This robust combination of microbes suits the industry as it is sold ready to use and allows flexibility with application timing which is critical in the high rainfall environment.\nSetbest foliar sprays support the soil biology. This is used 2-3 times per season to stimulate nutrient uptake in the plants. With even crops such as plant, first ratoon or nurse sucker this product is timed to maximise the nutrient content of the plant just prior to bunch initiation and bunch emergence. Setbest has also proven very effective at assisting the crop to overcome stress such as mite, chill or herbicide damage.\nDuring our agronomic work with bananas we have optimised our custom foliar applications for banana crops. We apply tailor made mixes of products to the bananas depending on the nutritional values of the soil and tissue and our agronomists in-field survey results.\nWe have been working with Mackay Estates since 2003 providing nutrient, pest, disease and irrigation monitoring. Our recommendations have resulted in a \"more nutritionally complete banana, providing a better consumer product\".\nGet in touch with an agronomist to discuss your banana crop.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

{"best_of": 1, "echo": true, "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 0, "model": "opt-1.5b", "n": 1, "prompt": "Anglers love to debate, banter and oftentimes engage in some plain old fashion bragging – usually, good-naturedly, I might add – when it comes to fishing. It’s always been that way and I imagine that kind of friendly discourse between anglers will always be a part of fishing, as it should be!\nIn keeping with that long-standing tradition of sportfishing, I wanted to tackle (yes, pun intended) one of those friendly, though sometimes passionately debated fishing topics – namely, what are the hardest-fighting inshore fish around. With a couple of caveats, of course, to help narrow the field.\nThere are many tough and thrilling fish all along our coasts here in the U.S. as well as in Canada, the Caribbean and many other parts of the world, but for the sake of this article, our candidates were confined to the East Coast, or Atlantic Ocean regions of the United States.\nTo be clear, this article does not aim to highlight inshore fish that are the most cunning, the strongest or may possess the keenest senses, though those qualities can certainly make catching and landing the fish more challenging. No, what we are after is sheer doggedness and an unconquerable fighting spirit. We are more concerned with what the fish does after-hookup than anything else.\nTo help decide this running debate (though I’m under no illusion that this or any other article will really ever accomplish that!), I reached out to some good fishing friends with experience targeting various inshore species as well as a few of the top guides and charter captains up and down the eastern coastline, from Maine to Florida.\nThe following are the results in reverse order from number 10 to first place, based on the survey of a handful of sport fishing pros and some everyday anglers who are as passionate about the debate as they are about fishing.\nSo, without further ado here is our list of the 10 hardest fighting Atlantic coast inshore fish (regardless of size) ranked in descending order.\nAlso called red drum and channel bass, the redfish is one of the most popular inshore species along the Eastern Seaboard. Reds won’t awe you with spectacular jumps like tarpon, but they will surely impress you with their strength, stamina, and ruggedness.\nThere are few things sweeter to an inshore angler than spotting them tailing in the grassy shallows or along a mangrove shoreline.\nWhen hooked, they will generally put up a good fight, with short but powerful runs, vigorous headshakes and plenty of tenacity. No wonder North Carolina made the redfish its official state saltwater fish!\nReverently referred to by seasoned flats anglers as the “gray ghost” for its extreme stealthiness, the bonefish is as tenacious as it gets and, pound-for-pound will put up a fierce fight when hooked. Though just 3 – 5 pounds on average, don’t let the bonefish’s lack of size fool you. There’s a reason they are so coveted by shallow-water fishermen from the Florida Keys to the Caribbean.\nTargeted on fly or light spinning tackle, you can expect long, powerful runs. In fact, so impressed was he with the fish’s fighting prowess, that Yvon Chouinard, avid fisherman and founder of the iconic outdoor brand Patagonia, had this to say during one bonefish outing, ” There’s no other fish I know of that can go so fast and so far”.\nAdd to that a no-quit attitude right up to the very end of the fight, one could easily argue that the bonefish should place even a spot or two higher on our list.\nCobia are just as much an inshore species as they are offshore denizens; they are as comfortable cruising along coastal waters as they are prowling deep wrecks. Targeted inshore from New England to South Florida from long piers and sandy beaches to shallow flats, the cobia is a top 10 fighter in every respect.\nThe cobia is a relatively big, powerful fish commonly taken in the 25 – 50 lb range (though they can certainly push the 70 lb mark and higher). But size and strength alone are not what make this shark-like (in appearance) gamefish the equivalent of an old-school bare-knuckle brawler.\nIf you want to catch cobia you better come prepared. We’re talking 30 lb test braid, stout tackle, and strong back preparedness. That is because you are going to be in for an extended battle with a fish that is as much known for its unpredictability as it is for its unrelenting fighting spirit.\nCobia are as individualistic as you’ll get in a gamefish and with that said, do not expect any two to fight in the exact same way. That is a big part of this species’ unpredictability – you’re not sure what you’re in for until you hook into one. I’ve caught cobia that have fought to the bitter end and I’ve also caught a few that have not lived up to expectations – hence the lower rating on the list.\nHowever, hook up with an angry cobia and you are in for the fight of your life. They will make your reel sing as they peel off several long and furious runs, and even when boated they do not give up, thrashing wildly about as if to say, “this ain’t over yet”. As an aside, it could also be argued that as table fare the cobia is the best on this list.\nThere are few things as exciting and awesome as watching a school of stripers in a frenzied blitz (often with bluefish in the mix) along the surf attacking baitfish. Cast out a bucktail, metal spoon or just about anything else and in very short order, you will find yourself in the fray. What a sensation!\nIt is this kind of aggressiveness that has endeared the striped bass to so many anglers up and down the Atlantic coast. Couple that aggressive nature with good size (anywhere from 5 to 25 lbs inshore; 40 – 50 lb specimen are not uncommon) and what you have is a predator gamefish that will ambush surface lures with abandonment and give you a fight every step of the way.\nWhen hooked striped bass will do everything they can to prevent you from landing them. They will pull like a freight truck, particularly on the first run, they will shake their head frantically side to side in an attempt to throw the hook, and they will dive for structure and try to cut you off. It is these fighting characteristics that have made striper fishing an angler favorite from Maine to northern Florida.\nThe Pompano, also known as Florida Pompano and Carolina Pompano, does not get enough credit for its fighting abilities. This is most likely because they are a smaller fish, enjoy a shorter season and have a smaller distribution range than most of the other species on this list (the Carolinas to Florida).\nBut it should come as little surprise that they landed on this list considering they are part of the jack family that features such outstanding battlers as the Crevalle Jack (Jack) and the Permit. In fact, the Pompano is sometimes mistaken for juvenile Permit fish and is often referred to as the Permit’s little cousin.\nShould you ever have the opportunity to fish for Pompano you will quickly understand why these diminutive (can get up to 8 lbs though most are in the 2 – 3 lb range) members of the Jack Family deserve just as much respect as their larger counterparts.\nPompano are prized just as much for their tenacious spirit as they are for their food value (and they are delicious!). Fighting prowess wise, there are even some anglers who feel they are better than Jacks. On light spinning, baitcasting or even fly fishing tackle, they provide a thrill-a-second experience as they take off on spectacular, fast and long runs after taking your bait. They are also deceptively strong and, during the fight, will feel as if they are twice the actual size.\nWhen fishing for Pompano in season, they can readily be caught along the surf from beaches as well as from fishing piers and inlets. A piece of advice: these fish are masters at taking your bait while going undetected with their soft, often imperceptible strikes, so use braided line for more hook-ups.\nThe Snook, or Common Snook as it is officially known, is probably Florida’s most popular inshore fish – and for good reason. They are a species that can be caught year-round (though they are strictly catch and release in the off-season).\nAnyone who has ever fished Snook will attest to their first-rate fighting ability. With their size (20 – 30 pounders are common), dogged determination and impressive strength, Snook are not an easy catch. Add to that the fact that they are often found around or near some structure – pilings, docks, and rocks – the odds of successfully landing a big, trophy-size Snook can quickly diminish.\nBut what a thrill they are on the line once hooked! The first run of an angry 20-plus pounder will be a challenge to any seasoned angler as the fish will do everything it can shake off your hook, foul your line or break you off on the nearest structure or with its sharp gill plate.\nHowever, should you be lucky or skillful enough to survive this first onslaught, you will most likely be treated to a spectacular display that often includes repeated powerful runs with changes in direction, some aerial acrobatics, frantic head shakes and the like. No wonder so many anglers become giddy with anticipation of the open of Snook season.\nThe Bluefish is a game fish that does not get enough respect, it just doesn’t have that glam factor that many other species enjoy. Maybe it’s because of their unspectacular size or perhaps because many people consider them inferior as table fare (I happen to know, however, they can be quite tasty in the right hands). But for whatever reasons they just are not taken seriously enough for their game qualities.\nBut having fished many different types of fish in many different locations and environments, I can tell you that as gamefish the Bluefish is, pound-for-pound, top-notch quality. From Maine to South Florida, you’d be hard-pressed to find another fish that is as tough or fights as hard as the Bluefish.\nRecently when I asked Frank Crescitelli (Capt. Frank) of Fin Chaser Charters of Staten Island, NY what he thought was the hardest fighting inshore fish, he told me, without any hesitation, that it was the Bluefish.\nThis is a guy who knows fishing. Captain Frank has fished just about every type of species in his long career, has clients the likes of MLB Hall of Famer (and IGFA record holder) Wade Boggs and was named one of the “50 Top Charter Captains” in the world by Saltwater Sportsman Magazine. He is also the star of “the Fin Chasers”, in its 3rd season on the Discovery Channel.\n“Let me answer this way. If I told you that I found a fish that lives in this remote river in the Amazon or a flat in a remote lagoon somewhere and that these fish behaved this way would you do whatever it takes to fish for them?\nThey eat poppers on the surface, both fly and spin. They’ll eat live bait right on the surface macerating them with their razor teeth.\nThey jump, scream line off the reel at blazing speed and can dog you by digging in and going deep and never give up fighting.\nEven out of the water they can see as good as in the water and will bite you given the chance. This eyesight can also make this usually voracious feeder quite finicky so sometimes they are in fact hard to catch. And to top it off they are hands down the best pound for pound fighter in the northeast inshore.\nHow do you argue against that! Thank you, Captain Frank.\nSimply referred to as Jack by anglers, this fish’s game qualities could essentially be summed up in two words – ultimate brawler. Belonging to the same family that gave us the Pompano and the Permit, the Jack looks mean and certainly has a bad disposition when hooked.\nBut what makes this fish a top, pound-for-pound fighter strength, stamina, and stubbornness. When hooked, expect the Jack to pull hard and long. Though they can reach 50-plus lbs as adults, even small juveniles can put up a fight worthy of admiration.\nFirst runs are long and powerful, followed by shorter but equally strong runs. Like their cousin the Permit, they are also adept at using their physical attributes, namely their muscular, wide bodies, to slow down the retrieve and tire the angler. Battling a 20 lb Jack will leave you exhausted and reaching for a cold one.\nIn my opinion, Jacks fall into the same underrated category as the Bluefish. Sure, they don’t make for tasty dishes and many anglers dismiss them as a nuisance when targeting other more “desirable” catches. But if we are purely judging the fish on its fighting ability, Crevalle Jack is a bonafide pound-for-pounder contender.\nAlmost unanimously, anglers agree that the Permit is one of the best shallow water game fish in the world. With their large and powerful sickle-shaped tails, deep muscular bodies and overall bullish appearance, Permit fish look like they were built specifically for a good fight. They may be one of the most skittish species on earth and just getting one on the hook is a challenge, but once you get one on the line you’d better hold on!\nThat because these fish can get big (commonly 20 lbs and up, with some specimen pushing 60 lbs) and possess world-class speed. You’d better be prepared and be packing some stout tackle when hitting the water in search of the big ones.\nThey will easily tear off 100 or 200 yards of line from your reel in the blink of an eye, change direction in the middle of the fight and run toward you, angle their wide bodies in water in an effort to put the brakes on you as are reeling them in, and so on. They are cunning, as stubborn as they get, and they don’t know the meaning of quit. For those reasons alone the Permit earns the number 2 spot on our list, and some would argue it should be in the top spot.\nOk, some of you might be saying, “here we go again with the Tarpon”. It seems that just about every publication or survey on inshore fishing has the Tarpon at number one for fighting ability. Well, that’s because it’s a fact – the Atlantic Tarpon is the hardest fighting fish, pound-for-pound inshore.\nAll of the species we’ve listed are prized for their tenacity and fighting spirit, but no inshore species is as tough to land as the Tarpon (also known as the Silver King and Sabalo). That’s because no other inshore fish combines size (75 – 80 lbs on average, with many in the 100 to 150 lb range and the occasional behemoth pushing 300 lbs), speed, stamina, and aerial acrobatics quite the way the Tarpon does.\nA little more on the Tarpon’s stamina. One of the great advantages Tarpon have over other fish is a uniquely formed air bladder that allows them to intake oxygen from the surface, giving them great endurance for those hard and long battles. This is one of the reasons for their ability to make multiple long runs and repeated spectacular jumps.\nAdd in the fact that they also possess color vision that is about 10,000 times greater than ours and gives them an edge in detecting your line in the water and boney mouths that make hooking them a challenge, to begin with, and you begin to get the picture – getting one of these inshore bruisers on your line and then actually landing one, is going to take everything you have as an angler!\nThe degree of difficulty in landing Tarpon was further highlighted by a study conducted by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. In their Catch-and-Release Mortality Study on Tarpon (2002 -2004; revised and updated in 2013), FWC researchers/anglers were only able to successfully land 37% of the 230 Tarpon hooked on breakaway jigs and live bait.\nHowever, should you ever have the opportunity to hook one of these big fish you are in for a thrill that will involve a screaming drag, violent head shakes, several strong runs and an aerial show like nothing you’ve ever seen from anything in the water.\nA seasoned angler can land a 100 lb Tarpon in about 30 minutes or so. For the novice Tarpon angler, that same fish could take as long as an hour if everything goes right. Regardless, exhaustion and sore muscles should be proof enough that you’ve tangled with the meanest, most stubborn and hardest fighting inshore fish on the Atlantic side, if not in the world.\nWhat Do You Think of Our Picks… Maybe Have a Different Top Ten List?\nWell, that’s it for our little top ten list. What do you think? Is the Tarpon the hardest fighting inshore fish… how about the placing of the other 9 contenders. Perhaps you have a different pound-for-pound top pick, or maybe a different order or even another Atlantic coast species that didn’t make it onto our list.\nLeave your thoughts in the comment box, and tight lines!\nThis entry was posted in Fish Species, Recreational Fishing, Saltwater Fishing on October 8, 2018 by Dorado.\nI hear so much about the challenge of Atlantic Tarpon but haven’t had the chance to ever try it for myself. It’s definitely on my bucket list.\nTarpon should be on every saltwater angler’s bucket list, BP. Few gamefish are as thrilling!\nFor me, I gotta go with tarpon at number one but I have to disagree with your second pick. I think jacks fight harder than permit, just my opinion.\nHey Gerald, thanks for chiming in. No knock there, the choice was a close call. They are both from the same hard-fighting family and either will put up an epic battle.\nArticles like these are so helpful. Every year we head to the beach for vacation and I will always have a couple of rods with me. I live nowhere near the ocean and fish just freshwater so being able to recognize what fish is what isn’t the easiest thing for me in the ocean.

I prefer watching streams to highlight videos since streams show solo/small gang EVE for what it is, hunting with 99% boredom and 1% terror. Most videos exclude out the 99% boredom part which is where most of the strategy lies. If I wanted instant PVP I would play CounterStrike.\nMy current play style is basically running a small gang as FC once or twice a month, plus lots of solo roaming 3 or 4 times a week. The solo roaming can be a pretty lonely existence so I started to broadcast the feed. With as many as a dozen viewers I jumped through gate after gate until eventually DIAF, sometimes with a kill or two, sometimes not.\nAll in all I have really enjoyed broadcasting and will now be broadcasting all of my future solo activities and probably some of my gang activities as well. You can find my broadcast when it is up at the top of this blog site (once the tourney is over), or at my site on OWN3d called 'Toterra'. Videos of the roams will be uploaded when complete. In general I will be broadcasting when I am on from 0200 to 0500 eve time depending on my RL schedule.\nOn paper the above fit is quite a beast. Overheated the X-Large Ancillary Shield booster can handle 1100 DPS. When that is reloading the Large on can take over and handle 460 DPS. Quite good. Even better with a Blue Pill. Targeting range is a sensor damping resistant 75km and the sensor strength of 19 gives it good resistance to ECM drones, if not good sufficient against jamming ships. Dual damage mods means the DPS is also reasonable with 538 using void and the drones, pumping up to 603 overheated. The Shield Boost Amplifier can be swapped out for a web to trade tank for tackle. This should be a good ship.\nUnder this right circumstances it works wonders. In one solo engagement I took on a shield tanked myrm and three frigates, emerging victorious. In small shield BC response fleets the ship also performed well.\nUnfortunately the envelope of engagements that this ship will do well in is rather small. It suffers from three major deficiencies, none of which can be remedied by switching out different modules.\n1. Short Range Weapons: With Null M this ship has an optimal of 6.3km + a falloff of 5.3km. That means that it can do sweet f@ck all damage to an enemy ship outside of scram range. Several times out roaming I was engaged by a target I should have been able to fight, but I was pointed and nothing I could do would get me in range to do real damage. Missiles and medium autocannons can usually accomplish something when a target is within warp disruptor range. These blasters can't. Switching to larger blasters squeezes the fitting too much.\n2. Small Cargo: This was really frustrating. The Cyclone has over a third more cargo space then a Ferox. This meant that while a Cyclone can hold ammo and two full reloads of cap boosters with room to spare, a Ferox can only hold a single reload with a couple of extra charges. This hurts in two ways. Firstly the Ferox can't keep its tank going for very long. Secondarily, once an engagement is finished, the Ferox urgently needs to find a safe harbour to resupply.\n3. Speed: The bane of Caldari ships, but considering that this one has to somehow get into close range... speed is just to essential.

How can you truly know anyone else, when we often know so little of our own lives? How, then, can anyone feel confident writing a biography on someone else? How can you sum up someone’s life into a few hundred words or pages? I think these are the questions that Whitman was wrestling with as he spilled his heart into Leaves of Grass.\nThis poem made me feel really isolated and lonely. I don’t think this is a very hopeful poem. I couldn’t find any glimmer of understanding or connections here, except maybe the “diffused faint clews and indirections”? I think that a lot of us here spend so much time with our noses in books because it helps us either process the world or feel connected to someone else. Whitman makes me question whether any of these connections are genuine, because they’re mostly one-sided attempts by me trying to reach out and touch the author. Maybe that’s why we turn to blogging about books, to try to share these connections with other book-lovers. I have a lot to think about this week — hopefully next week’s poem leaves me feeling a little more optimistic.\nSharing and understanding books collectively is always a lot better than solitary reading, I think the connections we make through books are genuine, in fact we probably have a richer connection with the world than a lot of people. Travelling would be better but who has the money or time for that when there is a rent to be paid.\nYes, plus you can time travel with books, and that’s something no amount of money can buy when you’re actually traveling!\nTime travelling is great and not dangerous like some of those ages prove to be.\nSharing our passion is great and you never know where it will end up, I have already been to the US and met three different bloggers as well as making friends with authors and bloggers all over the world I regularly email and Facebook and so on.

{"best_of": 1, "echo": true, "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 0, "model": "opt-1.5b", "n": 1, "prompt": "It is common knowledge that the majority of Melbourne’s older properties are most likely covered by the heritage overlay scheme which controls what can and can’t be done to the property to protect the history and heritage of the property.\nHowever, what is less commonly known is that these restrictions go beyond the house and include other items on the land, such as the fencing around the property. While I’m sure this won’t surprise some readers, I imagine there are others scratching their heads and wondering why on earth the heritage protection would cover minor items like fences, surely the heritage-listing only covers the home itself.\nHomeowners of a heritage property in Melbourne struck this very problem last year. The property, built in the 1920s, is covered by a heritage listing which restricts what can be done to the exterior of the property. The front fence of the property, built when the land surrounding the house was subdivided many years ago, was severely weather damaged and close to collapse and the homeowners applied to the council for a permit to construct a new front fence.\nProperties covered by the heritage register in Victoria must apply for a permit to do anything which alters the property, such as building repairs & constructions, extensions, subdivisions and construction of new structures such as fences or decks.\nOften, there will be a requirement for the proposed new structure or extension to be one which will be in-keeping with the heritage nature of the property, so in order to hopefully get the permit approved by the Council as soon as possible, it is wise for homeowners to engage a town planner or architect skilled in dealing with heritage overlays to prepare the permit application.\nThe homeowners in Melbourne engaged a skilled architect who designed a front fence which suited and enhanced the heritage aspects of the property, far more than the existing fence they were trying to replace. However, the permit application was rejected by the Council on the basis that the fence applied for was a height which would prevent pedestrians from seeing the heritage property over the fence. This was perhaps an excuse; the property in question is a large red-brick home which would clearly be visible over a high fence.\nAs a result of the Council’s rejection, the homeowners were required to go a step further and apply to VCAT to obtain a permit. Whilst it is possible to apply to VCAT to overturn a Council rejection of a permit application for a heritage property, it is important to be aware that success is not guaranteed and this route can be expensive. For the best prospect of success, it is essential to engage a specialist construction & planning lawyer, experienced in heritage matters, to prepare the case to be presented to VCAT. In addition, it must be noted that VCAT will likely not overturn the Council’s decision unless it can be demonstrated that there are significant reasons why it should be allowed. The heritage architect will likely be able to assist with the development of these arguments.\nThe homeowners in question were able to obtain a permit to construct a new fence after coming to a compromise with the Council at the VCAT hearing. Although they did not obtain the higher fence they applied for, they did obtain a permit for a fence between their requested height and the Council approved height. To obtain that concession from the Council, they were required to modify the fence design so that the wood panels were spaced slightly apart to allow pedestrians to view the house through the fence and to lower the height of the gates to allow pedestrians to view the house over the gates. Although these compromises weren’t ideal, the homeowners were willing to accept them to obtain the higher front fence.\nWhen owning, buying or considering purchasing, a heritage listed property, it is important to consider the future obligations under the heritage listing and whether you are prepared to undertake and comply with the extra permit requirements. Whilst it may be possible to overturn a Council’s rejection of a permit application through VCAT, this can be expensive and success is not guaranteed. To ensure the best chance of success at VCAT, it is advisable to engage a specialist construction and planning lawyer to prepare the application and to go to the hearing armed with compromises and concessions that you would be prepared to make for the best chance of coming to a mutually acceptable settlement with the Council.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

Got to the register and the cashier asked if I had any bonus points (not that I knew of) so he checked – turns out I had $15.00 in bonus points! Kept going with the sale; by the time he was done I not only saved $$$ but also got a coupon for another $10.00 off (good the next week) – can ya say “SCORE!”? Went to CVS and it was another repeat; I used a $5.00 ‘CVS Extra Bucks” at the register and the cashier & manager were both saying: “We’ve never seen THIS before!” Turns out I got back another 2 coupons: one for $2.00 off and another for $8.00 off!

Our choir director and his lovely wife (who is also our accompanist) are in another state for the holidays SOooooooo we did something we have never done before – we sang to a CD of the music. I must say – it took a bit of work as most are not used to that idea, but after practicing, we actually nailed it in the final performance so I was happy (as, I’m sure, was our assistant director!). During church I got a text from middle son asking if he & his girlfriend could take my husband & I out for lunch (as their Christmas gift to us) – so we went to a nearby Middle Eastern restaurant (girlfriend is Vegan & son is getting there). This was my second try at that type of food and I did my best NOT to let them know I really didn’t like ANYTHING I’d ordered – I DID try, though!

Managed to finish the ‘green beans’ shopping, found a nice ‘substitute’ for the large Hershey’s Kiss – this is one of those chocolate ‘oranges’ – it comes wrapped looking like an orange & when you open the foil, it’s slices of orange-flavored chocolate. Got the three loaves of bread baked; waiting for the third loaf to cool so I can wrap it & deliver to our neighbors (I only have 2 loaf pans, so had to do the baking in 2 batches). Husband noticed how miserable I was feeling and suggested he go pick up a Jet’s Veggie pizza for dinner (my favorite) so that works!!! He also suggested I start doubling up on taking Vitamin B12 (I had stopped a few weeks ago – no particular reason) so I took 2 just before I left to shop and am feeling a LOT better than earlier!

My fight is over.” He had spent 10 months enduring painful and difficult cancer treatments.\nWhen I read Krauthammer’s open letter, I was transported back in time to 2009 when my husband, Bruce, was in a very similar situation. After he was diagnosed with a fast-growing, late-stage cancer of the esophagus and endured six months of chemotherapy and radiation, we, too, believed he was in remission. But we had our hopes dashed two months later, when the tumors reappeared.\nThe responses flooded in, from people who knew him and had worked with him, and from people who barely knew him or had never met him in person but had benefited from his experience and knowledge. I learned from those people that they not only admired his professional accomplishments, they admired him for how he chose to face death. He showed us all that death doesn’t have to be traumatic, and that there are steps we can take to achieve the end of life experience we want.\n● Although 90 percent of those on Medicare say they want end-of-life care at home, only one-third achieve it.\n● Twenty-five percent of all Medicare spending is for patients who are in their final year of life, with most of that money spent in their last couple of months for care that is often of little apparent benefit.\n● The default standard of care is “all necessary care.” This standard of heightened levels of care contributes to the estimated $810 billion in unnecessary, unbeneficial or wasteful care provided to Medicare beneficiaries who spend most of their Medicare dollars in their last year of life.\n● A study of patients who understood themselves to be terminally ill with advanced cancers found that only 17 percent of respondents expressed interest in “life-extending treatment.” Instead, most patients valued quality of life over extending it.\nThere are institutional changes required to improve end-of-life care, including restructuring federal payment systems and policies to support palliative care and updating medical school curriculum to educate clinicians about end-of-life care. These are necessary components of a long-term solution, but institutions are slow to change.\nAnd it’s important for us to have role models for dying well. Observing the words and actions of those dealing with a terminal prognosis, whether we know them personally or only as figures in the public spotlight, can be an emotionally powerful way to gain new insights. Fear prevents us from even thinking about death, let alone talking about it or planning for it. But the more we know about other people’s journeys, the less we will fear our own. Perhaps, with each new experience that is shared, we will become more comfortable with the inevitable.\nIn the past months, several public figures have disclosed they were dying. A few days before she died, Barbara Bush announced through a family spokesman that she had chosen to have comfort care rather than additional medical treatment. And Krauthammer went public with his prognosis, telling us he had stopped treatment and showing us that he was using his remaining time to reflect on his life, say goodbye and spend quality time with loved ones.\nPublic figures can shine a bright light on important issues, but role models don’t have to be famous. They can be a relative, a friend, a neighbor or a colleague. We can all become part of this growing national dialogue on how we die.\nBy sharing your end-of-life journey, or that of a loved one — as I have done — we all have the opportunity to change someone’s life, and their death.\nSusan Ducharme Hoben is the author of the memoir “Dying Well: Our Journey of Love and Loss,” which recounts her husband’s last days.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

Big bloggers tell you to grow your list, and focus on it until it reaches a substantial size. Some will even tell you the secret: Content Upgrades. These 5 Content upgrades will grow your email list FAST.\nBut, before I get to that, if you’re ready for a BLITZ on your e-mail subscription strategy- I recommend signing up for this FREE 1,000 E-mail Subscriber challenge. We not only talk about the best content upgrades, but show you how to create them, and how to market them. Enter your e-mail below to kick it off!\nA content upgrade is a digital product offered to a reader, usually in exchange for an e-mail address, that is created for a specific blog post or page.\nBloggers often refer to content upgrades as lead magnets, opt-in bribes, or freebies.\nWhy do you need a content upgrade?\nContent upgrades bribe readers to provide an e-mail address in exchange for information. Offering content upgrades can increase your e-mail conversion rate, as much as 7 times as many subscribers.\nInternet users are getting more skeptical and less patient. If they are new to your website, they want the answer to the question they searched for, and they don’t trust you until they have the answer. To get a new user to give you their e-mail, you must bribe them with an enticing free offer.\nIn internets past, you could insert “Like this information? Sign up below” or a sidebar “subscribe now”, and get subscribers. But those tactics are less likely to convert with today’s savvy internet user. In fact, they may be blind to it altogether.\nA new approach works better: Give me your e-mail and I’ll give you this exclusive thing. However, not all content upgrades are created equal.\nThe best content upgrades are closely related to the blog post topic and solve a reader’s problem immediately.\nThe closer your reader feels the content upgrade is to your blog post, the better the trust developed. The reader can see you are really trying to help them.\nFor example, if you are writing a post about planning for Christmas, you might offer a workbook that could help them think of all the events they’re going to attend and write a schedule… OR you could make a pre-populated checklist with all the events they might attend with a spot to fill in the date.\nThe easier you make it on the reade, the better the content upgrade will convert. In this case, “done for you” is gold.\nLet’s dig into the 5 best converting content upgrades. But before we get to that, I invite you to join me in this FREE 1000 Subscriber e-mail challenge. We’ll help you create AWESOME content upgrades, and teach you how to market them to maximize your subscribers. Enter your e-mail below to start!\nOffering a free course to readers provides a HUGE value that you can accomplish for a low cost. This makes it very enticing for readers of your post to enroll to learn more.\nTo cut down on the creation time, use the information from the blog posts to develop the course content. This way, you are reusing and reworking content that you know your readers are already searching for.\nOne key benefit to courses that you may not consider: if you drip the content of the course out over time, the subscriber will become accustomed to hearing from you on a regular bases. That’s why we recommend creating and e-mail course that goes out over several days.\nCreating your free course as an e-mail sequence is a great way to create that regular touchpoint with your reader. To create an e-mail sequence like this, you’ll need an e-mail service provider.\nThere are many e-mail service providers, but our favorites are Convertkit and MailerLite. These make it easy to create a sequence of e-mails, and connect that to your sign up form on your blog.\nReaders love to be surprised with free gifts and bonus content. So don’t be afraid to frame it up that way. If you already created a free printable for another similar post, mention “I want to give you this free printable” and your reader will feel like they really got something special– because they did!\nWant more guidance on creating your own free course? Join our free course! The Get 1,000 E-mail Subscribers Challenge. Enter your e-mail below, then check your inbox!\nTo create a spreadsheet template you will needs a spreadsheet software. Two of the most popular options are Google Sheets and Microsoft Office.\nThere are many factors that will go into your decision, but the accessibility to everyone (license to the software) and the ability to share are the two reasons we prefer Google Sheets.\nWhy should you use Google Sheets for spreadsheet templates?\nGoogle Sheets is a spreadsheet software provided for free with a Google Account. However, not everyone has a license for Microsoft Office, and so they may not be able to access it.\nAlso, they are easily accessible on a Google Drive without you having to worry where you should store it! You can share a link to the document so that it can only be viewed, but not edited (except by you). Then, your readers can make a copy, and edit it themselves. Just be sure to provide instructions.\nThere are many more reasons to create a freebie using Google Sheets. They can be interactive, so your readers don’t have to do any calculations, the sheet will do the work for them.\nIf you know what you’re doing, a Google Sheet can take less than 30 minutes to make from idea to creation.\nWant to make your own freebie using Google Sheets? We’ll teach you how in the FREE E-mail List Building Challenge to get 1,000 Subscribers. Sign up below, then check your inbox!\nWorkbooks are a high converting content upgrade for your readers because they offer interaction, guidance and a “get this done” approach. When you create a workbook, you are telling readers that if they download this and fill it out, they’ll be able to achieve success.\nSome bloggers may refer to them as Companion Workbooks, Printables or Worksheets, but basically we’re after the same thing here: A document that you can follow along, fill in the blanks and work toward a goal.\nWhile workbooks do allow for very high conversions, making them can take some time. So consider carefully the post that you choose to make a workbook for.\nHow should you create your workbook?\nYou can use may different programs to create your workbook. Some of the most popular programs are Canva, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Powerpoint or Google Docs.\nHowever, you should always convert the document into PDF format before sending it to readers. Instead of sharing a Google Doc (like we did with Google Sheets), PDF format preserves all formatting, and is accessible for both Mac and PC users. With PDF Format, your reader can open, print and be working away in just a few seconds.\nLeave ample white space on the page. Readers may use this to take notes.\nChecklists are a simple content upgrade to offer to your readers. Checklists quickly address a need that you identify in your post (a list to remember, steps to take) so readers are happy to give an e-mail in exchange for the ‘done for you’ list.\nBloggers LOVE checklists because they are easy to make, simple to explain and convert readers into subscribers really well.\nReaders love checklists because they get a sense of accomplishment when they check things off, and they know exactly what it takes to accomplish a goal.\nHow to create a content upgrade checklist?\nSimilar to workbooks, you can create your checklist in Canva, Microsoft Powerpoint or Microsoft Word. Also, you’ll need to save your checklist in PDF format so that it can be shared and preserve the formatting.\nWith a checklist, keep in mind that readers may not print it out, but they might simply keep it on their phone to reference. PDF’s are very easy to read on your phone.\nReady to make a kickass checklist? We’ll teach you how in this FREE 1,000 E-mail Subscriber Challenge. Enter your e-mail below, then check your inbox!\nIf you have created a bunch of different free offers with your e-mail course, one way to show a HUGE value to readers is by giving them access to a resource library. Access to all of your freebies at once is very hard to resist!\nTo create a resource library, you’ll first need the content upgrades or freebies that you’ll put in the library. So, create some workbooks, checklists, spreadsheets and free courses first.\nAdditionally, your loyal subscribers should know about the resource library (they’ll feel like you gave them a HUGE gift!). So, in your weekly newsletter, send them the link and the password!\nCreating content upgrades and offering freebies on your site is a great way to turn casual blog readers, who may have just found you with a search, into regular loyal subscribers.\nOnce you have a reader on your e-mail list, you can share new posts with them (and get traffic to your site), Additionally, you can share helpful resources and products with them that can earn you money. Then, when you are ready to launch your own products, these readers will be the most likely to be ready to buy!\nSo, which content upgrade are you going to create? If you need help deciding, try our FREE E-mail List Building Challenge where we teach you how to create each of these (and more) content upgrades, and how to market them for maximum exposure!", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

During these conversations we kept coming back to why do we find ourselves holding on to things longer than we should - even things that aren’t good for us.\nI certainly know that I struggle with this, even when my rational mind knows the right thing to do. This is a perfectly human thing so when you’re giving yourself a hard time over this, know that you are not alone.\nOften the things we need to let go of especially the things that aren’t good for us make us feel comfortable when actually it's the fear to let go of them, because it will leave us with the unknown.\nThis unknown leaves us with the fear what if it's worse than what we have left behind.\nThe truth is we don’t always know, but if things in our life aren’t feeling in alignment no matter how big or small, it’s indicating to us that we need to make a change.\nThe best way to start is small and to get clear. Make a list of the things you need to let go of and mark them from what’s small to the bigger things. Obviously, if you’re feeling brave tackle the big things but more than likely you may find starting with the smaller things easier.\nGet clear on how letting go makes you feel, if it triggers fearful feelings look to shifting and changing these feelings. It will really help set a good foundation for letting go, taking baby steps with shifting these feelings may seem like nothing at first, but it will build momentum and pay off in the end. When we witness our fears they have less of a hold on us.\nThe next key is to identify that when you let go that an empty space has been created, and this is a powerful opportunity to fill it with something that you want that will enhance your life, so get clear with this and even this isn’t an instant thing, it’s the intention behind it that is everything.\nSomething I found incredibly powerful when a friend put it to me was to write down, ‘What's the worst thing that could happen if I let go of this?’. In a funny way, it helps because even if it isn’t great when you see this worst scenario, more than often its always ok in the end. This will help you take your power back, and it allows you to see everything for what it is.\nI would advise if you are struggling to enlist a trusted friend who’s not going to judge because this can really help you in the process of letting go, and you will feel more supported.\nMost importantly on this journey is not to judge yourself if you're finding it hard, often we may have to keep coming back to something before we fully let it go but sticking with it is key and knowing it’s ok to mess up and not be perfect. When we show ourselves kindness it’s easier to let go.\nSo as the autumn moves into full force and we watch the trees turn into beautiful colours and the leaves fall away, I wish you love and support for anything you may need to let go and know that you've got this.\nDo you find it hard letting go?", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

Philosophical synonyms for “connotation” are “sense,” “intension,” and “real definition.” Note this sense of “connotation” differs from the literary sense.\nThe denotation of the general term “square” is all squares.\nFew concepts are closed. Most concepts are open. This is not a big deal.\nAn open concept is one for which the connotation cannot be precisely specified; rather, we recognize members of the class by their resemblance to paradigms of the concept.\nNOTE: When we say that the concept “disabled person” is open, we mean simply that it is hard to decide in some cases whether that concept should be applied to an individual person. We do NOT mean to say that the concept is useless. Just because it’s hard to say in some cases doesn’t mean there’s no such thing as a disabled person! Arguing that way would be committing the continuum fallacy (see below).\nAll the interesting social, legal, and philosophical notions are open, and require argument by analogy to decide borderline cases: “person,” “good,” “religion,” “rich,” “sexual harassment,” “obscenity,” “minority,” etc. Such argument is important because it matters what we call things.\nIt’s important to realize that open concepts are normal and useful, even if we can’t define them as precisely as we can define closed concepts. It IS important to define terms when we argue. But sometimes we have to settle disputes about paradigms before we can begin to argue specific cases.\nClearly, you and your opponent are using very different definitions of “disability” – different paradigms. You’re not going to get anywhere if you don’t first come to some agreement about the paradigm cases. That’s where it’s important to “define your terms.” What does your opponent think “disabled” means? The burden of proof is on your opponent in this case to argue for his notion of disability. He must show first that it makes sense (is any conscious person disabled, on his view? if no one counts as disabled, does the term “disabled” mean anything anymore?).\nPeople are of course free to use words any way they like.

We proposed looking at the environment as a chance to lead, and develop a business strategy using sustainability as a lens to reveal hidden opportunities to create value.\n•Year 1 implementation resulted in >$500M in ROI (revenue enhancement and cost reduction).\n•Met or exceeded stretch goals around in-store and truck efficiency (between 2005 & 2008, Wal-Mart increased trucking efficiency by 38%, with plans to have it doubled by 2015).\n•Drove product innovation and supply chain transformations in fish, jewelry, textiles, electronics, and other categories. (e.g. Wal-Mart is working toward making all of its appliances Energy Star-rated).\n•Created a source of competitive advantage to recruit and retain key leaders. Successfully differentiated Wal-Mart in the marketplace.\n•Our client has a wide range of businesses including distribution and merchandising for music, video, books, and magazines as well as design, manufacturing and marketing of picture frames. For four businesses, the client wanted a comprehensive sustainability strategy that would drive innovation and proactively prepare for a future where customers and other stakeholders would increasingly care about sustainability.\n•90% of Wal-Mart’s environmental impacts are related to the products they sell. The Sustainability Index announced by Wal-Mart is a world-changing effort that will assess products across impact areas and drive innovation.\n•We developed a working model and roll out plan for the Index and socialized the concept within Wal-Mart leadership, a stakeholder steering committee and key suppliers, incorporating revisions along the way to create a truly collaborative approach to the Index.\n•We organized and facilitated a summit of 170 stakeholders in July of 2008 to tackle key questions about design and implementation of the Index.\n•A community of 170 diverse stakeholders committed to partnering in this effort.\n•The first phase of the Index launched in 2009.\n•Product category pilots continue to launch, further developing the product-level metrics.\n•A food retailer approached Blu Skye for help in rapidly framing a strategy to improve the health of their employees and customers by improving the nutritional content of the American diet.\n•We designed and facilitated a one-day working meeting with the company’s food merchants and a selected group of 10 nutrition experts and advocates including Kelly Brownell, Marion Nestle, David Ludwig, Michael Jacobson, Barbara Rolls, and Hank Cardello.\n•The meeting engaged the group in defining the issues related to food and nutrition which, if addressed, would have the biggest impact on health; identifying the actions the company could take that would make a difference in these issue areas; and developing leadership strategies in 6 key areas arising from the brainstorm. The company’s executives then created an action plan for implementation.\n•A client wanted to develop a global employee engagement program that was connected to their overall corporate values and successful sustainability strategy. The company hired Blu Skye to assess the situation and develop the overall strategy, framework, and content.\n•The business value of an effective employee engagement program was far wider reaching than anticipated. Aside from increasing productivity and reducing retention, there was potential to reduce health care costs. In addition, this program could be adapted to engage customers in sustainability, increasing customer satisfaction, building trust and brand reputation.\n•The program was rolled out globally in 2010. An online social networking tool allowed employees collectively track and share their progress. Performance was tracked using a management dashboard with key direct and indirect metrics.\n•In order to focus the efforts of their internal venture team in creating systemic change, our client wanted to understand what the world might look like at a time when 100% postconsumer take-back business models are viable.\n•Microsoft had committed to rolling out a series of sustainability initiatives to its global network of field offices, including ambitious global carbon footprint reductions for each of the next three years. To be successful, the company needed to enable the local markets to effectively execute on these initiatives. Our role was to help empower their global team of environmental sustainability leads, some of whom had minimal experience with sustainability and reducing carbon emissions, to deliver against company targets.\n•Our goal was to create a group of energized leaders, equipped with the tools to successfully execute the sustainability initiatives and achieve ambitious carbon reduction targets.\n•Co-created a three-day training summit for the environmental sustainability leads. This summit, which we co-led and facilitated, received outstanding feedback: 91% of participants rated it as “highly successful” in preparing them to execute against the company-wide targets.\nIn 2010 legislation to mandate the collection and recycling of primary batteries was accelerating, which if enacted would likely lead to higher costs for battery companies and sub-optimal environmental outcomes. It became clear that in order to have a battery recycling system that was economically and environmentally viable, the industry needed to work together with NGOs and regulators to create a national system.\nThe potential for a patchwork quilt of regulations and collection systems at the state and local level, tensions between stakeholders and the environmental performance and lack of national recycling infrastructure had prevented the creation of a viable national recycling system that battery companies would support. Blu Skye helped the industry create a stakeholder engagement strategy that drove towards a unified vision and a roadmap.\nAnalyze the system: We mapped the recycling system, identified the key stakeholders and value potential for them, and analyzed the environmental and economic impacts of the most compelling models for battery recycling. We summarized the challenges and opportunities in a briefing paper to help shape stakeholder dialogues on how a national system was possible.\nConvene the system: We designed and facilitated a 3-day “System-In-the-Room” summit with the key stakeholders focused on creating a shared vision and rapid proto-typing action plans for the creation of a national recycling system for household batteries.\nBuild momentum: We have been advising the steering committee to plan, fund and drive implementation of action plans developed at summit.\nAligned participants representing the five major battery manufacturers, NGOs and legislators around a common vision to develop a nationwide system that maximizes reuse of spent batteries with the goal of zero waste.\nGuided the industry coalition, The Corporation for Battery Recycling (recyclebattery.org), in implementation of action plans developed at the summit.\nLed the design of the national program for household battery recycling (in process, scheduled for launch in 2013), informed by six existing municipal battery collection programs that we are managing and gathering data from to support the program analytics and modeling.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

How to write a brilliant CV’ and ‘Career Coach’.\nDaydreaming about making a career change? Dreading Monday mornings and wishing you had a job that was a little more challenging, fulfilling or rewarding?\nFor some people though, a more radical shift may be in order. But switching careers at any stage in life can be daunting and the longer you’ve spent in your current job, the harder it can be to change direction. These three steps can help you get started.\nBegin by setting clear goals. It’s not enough to vaguely want something different. To make a positive step forward start by reflecting on your current role and identifying the enjoyable, as well as less enjoyable, aspects to understand why you really want a career change.\nConsider what exactly you’d like to leave behind and what you’d like to take forward. Then use these insights to create clear priorities for your next move. Having concrete goals and understanding the underlying reasons for a career change will shape the rest of your journey.\nTop tip: Make a list of your priorities, strengths, experiences and unique selling points. Be honest!\nNext, start to investigate different career options. It’s great to have a dream job in mind, but it’s important to understand the day-to-day realities of it – it may not be as exciting as it looks from a distance.\nTry drawing on your existing networks to learn more about the role. Talk to family and friends about your goals and find out if they know anyone working in your target industry. Seeking out and attending sector-specific networking events, like conferences or forums, is also a great way to meet industry professionals. These individuals can provide advice on the day-to-day experience, how to break into the field and must-have qualifications.\nTop tip: When networking, don’t just launch into a monologue about your goals. You’ll make a better first impression if you create a two-sided conversation and ask about their experiences.\nIt’s important to present any career change as a natural evolution rather than a radical change. To achieve this, try focusing on any similarities and transferable skills that can help to bridge CV gaps.\nSay for example that you’re a teacher but you’d love to work in a museum. In this case, you’d want to show how group management and lecturing skills apply to running guided museum tours. On the other hand, if you’re an accountant wanting to move into the legal world, you could include any experience with contracts on your CV.\nIf there aren’t any clear career similarities, it might be necessary to gain more experience by taking an online course, working in voluntary positions in your free time or finding opportunities to build transferable skills within your current organisation.\nTop tip: Internships aren’t just for recent graduates. They can be a way for anyone to build experience and test the waters of a new career.\nExplore careers, find online courses and more at National Career Services.\nRead more career tips and advice from Corinne Mills.\nBarney Whiter – The Escape Artist – is the author of a blog dedicated to financial freedom. He writes about making money work hard for you, rather than you always having to work hard for your money.\nIn a world where people are living and working longer, the idea of early retirement has risen in popularity. Driven by millennials and online communities, the Financial Independence Retire Early (FIRE) movement looks at how aggressive saving and canny investments can enable the goal of early retirement.\nFinancial independence means you never have to work again (but you can carry on if you want to!).\nGetting there is a bit like building a house… yes, it’s a big job, but it’s possible if you take it one brick at a time. Small steps over time can add up to big results.\nHere are three ways you can start the journey and take the steps you need to maximise your earnings, minimise your spending and look into ways you could grow your money.\nThe time it takes to get to financial independence depends on the % of your income you save. And, let’s be honest, it’s easier to save more on a higher income.\nTake more risk – for example, could you go self-employed?\nGet a side hustle – could you start a small business alongside your job?\nIt’s up to you to take ownership of your career. You could start by trying for a raise at your current job. Maximise your leverage by working hard and walk into your next performance review with a competing job offer in your back pocket.\nOr what about getting a lodger? Many people are rattling around in houses or large flats with spare rooms. You can earn £7,500 a year tax-free in the UK by renting a room out.1 Check out sites like www.spareroom.co.uk.\nWhat if you could get paid to do something you love? Why not take a course at The Pop-Up Business School where they’ll teach you how to start a side hustle or small business? It’s free!\nBy itself, earning a lot won’t get you to financial freedom. You also have to save hard.\nBegin by tracking where your money goes. After a month of that, attack your spending. Start by reviewing the larger items and working down the list to smaller impulse purchases.\nAsk yourself some questions. Are you on the best mortgage rate? Are you on the best gas/electricity deal? Do you really need that second car? Why not cancel that cable TV subscription? Could you shop at a lower cost supermarket? Instead of a beach holiday, what about a staycation? Could you cut down on the takeaways and ready meals and prepare food at home instead? Why not turn down your thermostat by one degree?\nYou might think that more spending brings more happiness. But studies show that, above a certain level, additional spending won’t make you happy. Many people could cut their spending whilst becoming happier.\nCould you drive to your European holiday destination rather than fly? If you have kids, this can save you thousands in school holiday season.\nOr what about cycling to work? Cars are like money incineration units: the larger they are, the more money they burn. Bikes on the other hand are incredible frugality machines that give you great legs.\nNow you’re saving, it’s time to look at how you might invest the surplus into wealth-generating assets (such as shares or property) that have the potential to compound in value over time.\nIt is much easier than you think to manage your own investments, but it does require some learning. Make sure you’re not paying too much in fees and expenses. The sooner you start this, the longer and the harder your money will work for you.\nHowever you decide to proceed, remember to think long-term and consider the ups and downs of the stock market or property. Don’t forget to think about risk as well as return – and keep in mind that there are no guarantees when it comes to investing.\nDo you even know what’s going on in your pension? Why not start by finding out. What are the fees? And what % is invested in shares (the asset class that has historically done best over time)?\nTo see how easy it can be to invest your own portfolio, why not open a practice account with The Share Centre – you can learn while investing “monopoly money” with no risk and no cost.\nThese baby steps can add up over time to create amazing results. Remember: the most important thing is to get started!", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

Food allergies or hypersensitivities are relatively uncommon but should be suspected if an animal develops itchy skin, vomiting and/or diarrhea and other more frequently diagnosed disorders (e.g., allergies to environmental triggers like pollens or molds, fleas or primary gastrointestinal disease) have been ruled out.\nTo diagnose a food allergy, a pet must be fed a diet that contains protein and carbohydrate sources that the animal has never eaten before. Commercially prepared foods that are made with venison, duck, rabbit and potato are available, or an owner may choose to prepare a homemade version. All diets must be nutritionally complete and should avoid beef, lamb, pork, soybean, egg, dairy, corn, wheat, barley, rice and for cats, fish as most animals have been exposed to foods containing these ingredients. Any treats that are fed should contain the same ingredients as the pet's new food. All other potential sources of dietary allergens, including table scraps and chewable medications, must be eliminated. Owners need to feed this strictly limited diet for two to three months and monitor their pets for any improvements in their clinical signs before the dietary trial can be deemed a success or failure.\nIf a pet's condition improves significantly during the diagnostic period, food allergies are at least partially to blame for its symptoms. Owners may elect to continue feeding the same diet that was used during the food trial or to reintroduce protein and carbohydrate sources one at a time to determine what the trigger may be. An animal's symptoms should return within one to ten days of being fed an offending ingredient. Whichever approach is taken, lifelong avoidance of the substances that trigger an allergic reaction is necessary to keep food-allergic pets healthy and happy.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

And what about the 31?\nBecause there are plenty of buses that run between Westfield and Shepherds Bush and most aren't exactly busy.\nThe 96 cannot really be compared to any White City routes because the 96 is the main trunk route to Bluewater and the highest frequency TFL service in Bluewater. The 96 is busier weekends when people want to go to Bluewater to do their shopping.\nIn regards to the 148 I don't really think cutting the route to Shepherds Bush Permanently is necessary, the bus station was built for buses to stand, people use that section, but not large amounts and to be honest that section of the 148 is unique even if it takes a little longer than the other routes, the 148 is also busy pretty much the entire route, Shepherd's Bush is the stop most people board and alight. Whilst the route is cut for a short time there are plenty of routes to get to White City Bus Station or people can walk through the Shopping Centre.\nThe 148 traditionally terminated at Shepherds Bush Green, when Westfield White City opened it was extended up Wood Lane to terminate there as it was seen as a useful link despite modest demand. I assume TFL rerouted the 31 via Shepherds Bush Station as there wouldn't be a demand for another route via Shepherds Bush Green. On that basis the 148 is alright as it is.\nInteresting from Twitter. Someone asking when the 3 Will go back To Oxford Circus. Tfl bus alerts am say it is a permanent change. Asked why no consultation, tfl bus alerts advise to contact customer services.\nNow I know there is no point in these consultations anyway, but when are they required to have a consultation and when are they not?\nNo consultation for 7/98 as far as I'm aware and looks like that is definite now permanent, yet tfl consult for minor things such as tweaks in frequency?\nI wouldn't be surprised if for some routes they never go back.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

Today’s designer must become fluent and engaged with this critical new domain that includes a range of transdisciplinary approaches, from bioengineering and biotechnology, to biomimicry, biofabrication and biodesign. In this Studio, teams of students will explore this new area from a social and critical context, and develop a biologically informed intervention as part of the The Biodesign Challenge competition (http://biodesignchallenge.org/). Participating students will have a groundbreaking opportunity to learn about biodesign and apply it to their own practice, while being exposed to many perspectives and approaches. They will also learn how designers collaborate with researchers and practitioners from the scientific community. Teams will push the limits of current industries and provoke new ways to design for the future. We will examine and discuss issues from genetic privacy to modified foods, to understand the fears and debates about the future of biotechnology, and to inform future designers to work with biotech thoughtfully and ethically. Winning teams will be chosen and the winners will go on to showcase their work and present their projects in front of key museum curators, scientists, professional designers, and companies at The Biodesign Challenge Summit in June 2019. Other participating universities include CMU, Penn, NYU, Rensselaer Polytechnic, FIT, SAIC, SVA, MICA, and SciArc.

By combining that data with the right tools and technologies, marketers can achieve true personalization at scale, reducing customer acquisition costs by as much as 50 percent. Nowhere is this more evident than in email, which continues to outperform all other marketing channels. But to truly understand the success of personalized email campaigns, brands are still missing key data on how consumers are responding to their efforts.\nWith Campaign Monitor’s recently launched, Insights, marketers have a complete view into the measurement and performance of a business’ email marketing investment, with interactive dashboards and reports. Now, all of our customers can quickly understand their email marketing performance data, report on results and act on the insights from a central, easy-to-use hub — without the help of a data analyst.\nTo further support the launch of Insights and the need for data-driven marketing programs, Campaign Monitor surveyed more than 1000 consumers across the United States to find out how they prefer to engage with brands and what types of email messages resonate most. Are they more likely to open emails with personalized subject lines? Do certain industries use email more effectively than others? How do millennials respond to email vs. social?\nConsumers Still Prefer Brands to Communicate via Email: There is no doubt, consumers still love email. More than half (52.7%) of those surveyed in the U.S. check their personal email account more than 10 times a day, and it is by far their favorite way to receive communication from brands.\nMarketers Are Delivering on Personalization: Across all industries, companies are delivering on the promise of personalized emails by communicating timely and sharing relevant information that satisfies their audiences. Retail remains on top, with 76% of consumers agreeing that retails brands are sending relevant, accurate emails tailored to their shopping needs, followed by the travel, entertainment, nonprofit and media industries.\nDiscounts and Personalized Subject Lines Drive the Most Opens: It’s easy for emails to get lost in the fray. Our study showed that the top reasons for consumers to open an email from a brand are discount offerings (72%) and personalized subject lines (62%). While personalizing an email is a proven strategy to boost click-through-rates, discounts have shown to be one of the top reasons for consumers to subscribe to a newsletter and engage with a brand.\nMillennials Lead the Way in Making Purchasing Decisions Based on Email: When it comes to taking action based on email, millennials are far more likely to do so. Despite the abundance of available communication channels, email remains the most engaging method for communication among millennials, with 58% “always” or “most of the time” donated to a nonprofit while just 18% of respondents 55+ did the same.\nAt Campaign Monitor, our customers continue to design some of the world’s most inspiring and effective email marketing campaigns – and we want to keep them ahead of the game. With a new understanding of what consumers want from brands, and the right technology at their fingertips, marketers can deliver new value to the customers they serve.

Bare with me. After Logmein delivered a huge blow to occasional remote access users everywhere, I’ve been thinking about the state of Remote Control tools. I’m not saying this to list all the different options there are, and gosh there are many; but to look at what has made Logmein and similar tool, Teamviewer, become so powerful.\nThe one common ingredient with Logmein and Teamviewer are the ability to punch through firewalls and effectively remove the need for time-wasting port configuration. Logmein does go further by providing online status and other “Pro” features, but the big and valuable feature of these two utilities is in firewall traversal. If you’re a VNC, or Remote Desktop or Radmin user, you’re likely familiar with the two-step process of opening a port, creating a gateway server and connecting.

{"best_of": 1, "echo": true, "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 0, "model": "opt-1.5b", "n": 1, "prompt": "Jurors in the involuntary manslaughter trial of Michael Jackson's personal physician went home for the weekend without reaching a verdict.\nFriday was the first full day of deliberations for the seven-man, five-woman panel considering the fate of Dr. Conrad Murray.\nThe jurors range in age from 32 to 57. By their own description on the questionnaire, six are Anglo, five Latino, and one African American.\nIn terms of background for understanding the complex medical information, Juror 10 may be the best qualified. She got a Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry in England and worked for awhile as a lab technician. She moved to the San Gabriel Valley a 12 years ago. Her husband also has a science background and works in engineering. Juror 3 has an MBA and only two of the jurors do not have at least some college work.\nJurors will return Monday at 8:30 a.m.\nHow long will it take them to finish? That's anyone's guess. Gerry Schwartz, who was in the pool of prospective Murray jurors, says the group may want a few more days in the spotlight.\n\"They're finally in a position of power, where everyone is waiting for them to give the word,\" says Schwartz. \"I think psychologically, you're going to enjoy that a little bit.\"\nThe six-week trial combined emotional testimony, including recordings of Murray and the King of Pop, and detailed scientific analysis from medical experts. Attorneys relied on both Thursday during closing arguments.\n\"Every single doctor that testified in this case said would never do what Conrad Murray did,\" Deputy District Attorney David Walgren told jurors.\nBut defense attorneys insisted that the pop superstar was responsible for his own death. They claimed Jackson created a \"perfect storm\" of drugs inside his body that led to his death on June 25, 2009.\n\"At what point to we draw the line about Dr. Murray's responsibility for a grown-up,\" defense attorney Ed Chernoff said during closing arguments.\nThe jury is considering the attorneys' arguments and testimony from nearly 50 witnesses. Deliberations began at about 8:30 a.m. Friday in a downtown Los Angeles courthouse.\nOutside the courthouse, crowds of Jackson and Murray supporters gathered in ancticipation of a verdict.\n\"We would like to get justice for Michael,\" said Jackson admirer, Felesha Wilson.\n\"I am most concerned and thankful that we do have a jury so that we can get answers to our many questions,\" said Murray supporter Beatrice Fakhrian. \" And, I believe that Dr. Murray will be exonerated.\"\nMurray was seen earlier this week walking with his girlfriend, who was a prosecution witness, along the beach in Santa Monica. When asked whether he was looking forward to putting the trial behind him, Murray said, \"I can't wait buddy.\"\nThe final days of testimony focused on science -- two experts on the drug blamed in Jackson's death took the stand -- but Walgren repeatedly mentioned Jackson and his children during his closing argument. He told the jury that even when Murray's trial is over, Prince, Blanket and Paris will continue to live with the result of Murray's mistakes.\n\"It is abundantly clear that Conrad Murray acted with criminal negligence, that Conrad Murray caused the death of Michael Jackson, and that Conrad Murray left Prince, Paris and Blanket without a father,\" Walgren said before exiting the courtroom to an ovation from Jackson fans in the hallway.\nHe also noted that what really happened on June 25, 2009, in a mansion on Carolwood Drive might never be known.\nDefense attorneys told the jury the decision comes down to whether Murray committed a crime or whether he was an unethical doctor. They portrayed Murray as an outsider who was brought into Jackson's world at time when the singer was driven to please fans with a series of upcoming London concerts.\n\"The defense raised the question, is it really apparent how Michael Jackson died?\" said NBC4 legal analyst Royal Oakes.\nIt was after a rehearsal for those concerts -- organizers originally planned about 30, but upped the numbers to 50 after pre-sale demand for tickets -- that Jackson returned to his rented Holmby Hills mansion. During the early hours of June 25, 2009, Jackson pleaded for something to help him sleep, Murray told investigators.\n\"He tried to close his eyes, and nothing would work,\" Murray said during the two-hour interview granted two days after the entertainer's death. \"He complained that he would have to cancel rehearsals... and not satisfy his fans if not rested well.\"\nMurray administered propofol, a powerful surgical sedative that Murray said Jackson called his \"milk,\" later that morning, he told investigators. He then left the room to use the bathroom and noticed Jackson wasn't breathing when he returned, Murray said.\nProsecutors claim that Murray's decision to administer propofol, usually reserved for use in a surgical setting with proper medical equipment, as a sleep aid in Jackson's bedroom was just one of the many mistakes that led to the King of Pop's death. That he left the bedroom, even for a few minutes, was another violation of the \"sacred trust\" Jackson had with his doctor, prosecutors said.\nBut the defense told jurors it was Jackson who administered the fatal dose. They also claimed Murray did not know Jackson ingested the drug lorazepam. Prosecutors and their witnesses developed stories over time that placed the blame on Murray, the defense argued.\n\"They want you to convict Dr. Murray for the actions of Michael Jackson,'' Chernoff said.\nEven if the defense's self-administration theory is correct, prosecutors said the jury should still convict Murray because of negligence. Murray's use of propofol as a sleep aid, his delay in calling 911 and failing to tell paramedics and ER doctors he administered propofol were just some of his \"bizarre\" actions, Walgren said.\n\"Poor Conrad Murray,'' Walgren said in his closing argument. \"Michael Jackson is dead. And we have to hear about poor Conrad Murray and no doctor knows what it's like to be in his shoes.\"\nMurray faces up to four years in prison and loss of his medical license if convicted. Judge Michael Pastor will determine the sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

In the Sutlej valley, in the shadow of the mighty Mount Kailash, the ruins of the once great capital and its surroundings can be found. Founded in the 10th century by the descendent of the last Emperor of Tibet, it's cited as the start of the second wave of Buddhism into Tibet. Ruled, conquered and annexed by dynasties and monarchies over the years and finally lost in the 17th century in mysterious circumstances, the site of Guge was rediscovered in the 1980s during a large archaeological project, and now tells a fascinating story of the area's history.\nBuilt into an earthy hill, the sculptures, carvings and murals were that were discovered, not to mention the houses, once-inhabited caves, monasteries and soaring stupas are an irresistible draw for visitors seeking to find the treasures revealed in this sprawling site. To explore Guge is to journey back in time and discover the relics, sculptures and murals uncovered in these sacred buildings, lost for three centuries.\nAdorning the walls of the central, single-storey hall are detailed paintings of emperors, monks, lamas and deities. They are depicted in bright vivid colors and clothed in rich textiles - a fascinating insight into the artistic style and dress of the time.\nThe Guge Kingdom was rich in gold and silver and these precious metals were used in much of the sculptural designs. Perhaps the most famous is the Guge Silver Eye, an intricately-carved and miraculously-preserved sculpture.\nSurrounding the site are the neighboring villages of Dongga, Daba and Pingyang. Though the original inhabitants of Guge kingdom were all but wiped out in the 17th century, many of their treasure and relics were rescued and now have their homes in these humble villages.\nOnce the capital of the Guge region, Tholing was home to one of the oldest and most important monasteries, central to Tibet’s second diffusion of Buddhism. Built in distinctive red brick, it’s surrounded by ruins but many of its central buildings and artifacts have survived including beautiful sutras written in silver ink.\nPart of the Tholing monastery complex, the temple is built of mud brick with elaborate, decorated towers. In the 10th century, the Indian master Atisa organized one of the first conferences here and two exquisite, detailed murals remain intact despite heavy demolition over the centuries.\nThe best way to experience Tibet's beautiful landscape, wildlife and cultures is to hike the ancient foot trails and camp. Surrounded by wilderness, travelers fall asleep under the stars and wake up to crisp Tibetan air and unspoiled scenery each morning – campsites really allow travelers to connect with their environment and enjoy the serenity of the Himalayas. Accompanied by guides and horses or yaks transporting camping equipment, you will stay at established campsites with all food and drinks provided, with meals prepared by an experienced chef.\nPerfectly located for exploring the surrounding delights of the ruined city of ancient Guge, the Xiangxiong Hotel is set in Shiquanhe Town in nearby Ali. The large hotel, while not luxurious, is one of the best options in the area and provides a comfortable respite after a day of exciting discovery. With 58 rooms, ranging from singles and doubles to suites, there are configurations suitable for all parties. While it’s not overwhelmingly sumptuous by international standards, the accommodation is clean and adequately equipped with televisions, air-conditioning and WiFi, as well as complimentary coffee and tea facilities. The hotel restaurant serves up a range of dishes from local Sichuan specialties and Cantonese classics to western favourites. For guests who still have a little energy left over for some evening entertainment, there is a games rooms as well as singing and dancing in the ballroom. Meanwhile, those seeking a little relaxation can retreat to the beauty salon or the spa and sauna to unwind.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

In my community garbage is picked up on Mondays which is so convenient after the weekend. If you were able to peek in on my life on Mondays, you would find me gathering all the garbage around the house that I can find. I visit each of the bathrooms and empty their small garbage cans. I also search through the refrigerator to examine the plastic containers to see if anything is not edible anymore. You know the ones hiding behind the milk on the lowest shelf in the back that we tend to forget are there! I move quickly through the basement and garage to find any leftover wrappers of newly opened items. After breakfast (which of course is the last portion of cereal in the cereal box), I toss all the crumbs and remains in the plastic bag I have been carrying around all morning. At last, the plastic bag is full, and I slip on my shoes to run to the end of the driveway where my husband has already put the garbage can. In goes the rest of the trash collected that morning. The walk up the driveway is always exhilarating! Why? It is because I have just emptied my house of one more bag of debris and junk. Usually, I feel lighter than air because I am walking into a home that is cleaner, fresher, and emptier than it was a few moments ago.\nIt is similar to the feeling I have when I spend time in prayer especially my times of true confession to God. It seems that when I confess to the Lord the accumulated sins in my life, I immediately feel fresh and clean like my house on garbage day. Sometimes my failures stand out like a piece of litter on my grass. Other times I need to do an honest search to find the offensive ways lingering in the corners of my heart just like the crumbs hidden under my kitchen table. Unlike the garbage man who is only able to pick up my trash once a week, our forgiving Father is always ready and waiting to forgive our transgressions. Sinful habits such as impatience, pride, stubbornness, and worry give us impure hearts. Praise God we do not have to wait to experience His cleansing power of forgiveness! We can have pure hearts when we make every day a garbage day!\nForgiving Father, create in me a clean heart. Amen.\nI too really appreciate garbage day. It’s a purging, which as you noted, makes you mindful of the removal of debris.\nThis can be applied to confession as well. God clears out the debris of our heart.\nLets not forget to recycle!

The team led by Ph.D. candidate Leif Jentoft and postdoctoral fellow Yaroslav Tenzer in Harvard’s Biorobotics Laboratory started a company to commercialize the technology, and are licensing it through Harvard’s technology transfer office.\nTakkTile, as the product and company are called, uses ordinary but miniature barometers configured as micro electro-mechanical systems, that measure air pressure protected by a layer of vacuum-sealed rubber. While the circuits inside a sealed rubber coating can withstand the impact of a baseball bat, a robotic hand configured with these sensors is sensitive enough to pick up a balloon without popping it.\nTactile sensing is not a new idea, but the sensors devised by Jentoft and Tenzer are much less expensive than current technologies, which should make them more attractive to developers of robotic and other electronic systems. The developers were able to slash the cost of the sensors through a process based on standard fabrication methods and miniature barometers currently used in mobile phones and GPS devices to sense altitude.\nTakkTile the company is using a marketing strategy that makes the basic technology plans, code, and tutorials available through open source to quickly get them in the hands of potential developers. The company then sells a basic hardware starter-kit and offers consulting services for a fee. To build commercial applications, however, the technology must be licensed through Harvard’s Office of Technology Development.\n“Not everyone has the bandwidth to do the research themselves,” says Tenzer, “but there are plenty of people who could find new applications and ways of using this.” Some of those new applications, beyond robotics, contemplated by TakkTile are medical devices in sensitive surgeries and stuffed animals that can respond to a child’s petting.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

{"best_of": 1, "echo": true, "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 0, "model": "opt-1.5b", "n": 1, "prompt": "The Modi administration has done much to strengthen ties with India´s long-standing friendly European partner. Today, new business and investment opportunities being created in India are cementing this relationship even further.\nThe two nations have come a long way since way back in the sixties when the then budding French National Space Agency (CNES) and what would later become the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) laid the building blocks for cooperation. The two agencies signed an agreement in 1964 to build Belier and Centaure sounding rockets in India, with the accompanying transfer of solid-propulsion technologies. That marked the start of many agreements that followed over the years. ISRO and CNES marked the 50th year of their collaboration last year. Today, French companies continue to explore their maiden ventures in India, driven particularly by the growth opportunities of a young and populous nation in dire need of basic services in large swathes of the country, but also increasingly aspirational.\nKeen on delivering the enablers for these aspirations, a proactive Narendra Modi-led government has reached out to stakeholders worldwide, with long-standing partner France expected to play a key role.\nAcross infrastructure and other sectors, France already has a substantial presence in India, numbering 400 French corporate companies with about 1,050 branches, employing over 300,000 Indians. As these companies localise for India, the management of these companies is also increasingly passing on to Indian hands. This is evident from the fact 60 per cent of the 400 French companies are headed by Indian citizens.\nIn addition, there are about 200 independent French entrepreneurs with their offices in India. The presence of small sole proprietorship companies and small and medium enterprises (around 50-70) has also increased, adding to the share of French investments.\nNot just limited to manufacturing, French companies are looking at the country as a centre for innovation and research & development (R&D). Biard estimates there are close to 20,000 people engaged in pure R&D and innovation. ¨They do lots of æIndianisation´ or localisation of products for the local market. Some of them also use India for innovating for other markets such as the emerging markets. The idea is to benefit from the spirit of innovation that India is known for, to do some kind of disruptive innovation in addition to fundamental research India is capable of with its large pool of engineers,¨ says Biard.\nIn fact, there is even an R&D club, coordinated by the Embassy and the consulate in Mumbai. R&D managers of companies gather for discussions on an informal basis to discuss and collaborate on relevant issues. The club already boasts of about 50-60 companies participating on a regular basis.\nThe development of urban infrastructure is increasingly seen in the context of the Smart Cities project, one of the PM´s pet projects.\nOlga Chepelianskaia, international expert on clean energy, eco-efficient urban development and the Managing Director at Erg Terra Expertise says the key element is having an innovative approach to planning. ¨In France, we have realised that a very hard approach to city planning often doesn´t work. I think this is even more valid in India because by the time you have set up a master plan, the demography has changed, priorities have changed. City networks have changed because of the continuous arrival of people in the city,¨ she says.\nShe suggests a more negotiable approach. ¨In France, we now talk about strategy as opposed to a plan. If you think about it, this gives you more flexibility. It means you do plan but you are ready to change according to the conditions that arise,¨ says Chepelianskaia.\nSo far, France has expressed interest in three cities on the Smart Cities project short-list, namely Chandigarh, Nagpur and Pondicherry, and will firm up its interest once the final list of cities is out in January 2016.\nAerospace and defence is another area of significant cooperation. Bringing companies from the two nations together on a common platform, BCI Aerospace, the specialised division of Advanced Business Events (ABE) for aviation and defence events, organised its first Aeromart Summit in Bengaluru in 2014. With 179 companies attending, 481 participants and 3,795 business meetings, the event drew leading companies from France such as Airbus, ATR, Safran, Aerolia and Dassault Aviation as well companies from other countries and India. BCI Aerospace is now set to organise the second edition of the ssummit in May 2016.\nThe first-mover advantage goes to India´s Mahindra Group with its subsidiary Mahindra Defence announcing in July this year it is teaming up with Airbus Helicopters to produce helicopters in the country for the military. Historically, Indian companies have been clients for Airbus and ATR aircraft. Air India, IndiGo Airlines, Jet Airways and AirAsia India already host extensive fleets of Airbus passenger aircraft.\nWhile an exhaustive look at all the business opportunities thrown up is beyond the scope of this article, suffice to say France is set to play a bigger role in India´s push for growth in the years ahead. As the Indian government continues to create a suitable environment for business as much in matters of strategic importance as on projects being implemented at the ground level, the possibilities to collaborate, learn together and share experiences are endless.\nIn the humdrum of business and the excitement of cooperation towards achieving greater numbers and better profitability, it is easy to lose sight of the more humane aspects of development. Perhaps, it is fortuitous one partner, India, has a storied cultural past while the other, France, is arguably more aware of the importance of one´s culture and alive to cultural nuances more than any other nation on earth.

I love coffee for its delicious darkness (especially when it’s really strong, the way my husband makes it). It is the fuel that gets me going in the morning, the brew that gets me out of the murkiness of sleep and into some semblance of focused coherence. And there are times when I’ll drink it in the evening, too. On those rare occasions when Scott and I escape for a dinner date, there is nothing like a nice decaf cappuccino to round out the meal.\nBut for the most part, if it’s not the morning, then I’m drinking tea. This is especially true when I’m writing. There is just something about a cup of tea, its steam rising up like incense, that gets my creativity going. Perhaps this is because drinking tea is, by its very nature, a slow and meditative process; you have to sip it, not gulp it, and that leisurely pace is very conductive to writing. Perhaps it’s because I associate tea with the English authors I’ve loved ever since I was a child, when I devoured The Secret Garden and the books of Noel Streatfeild. Tea has an emotional resonance for me, reminding me of those stories where characters routinely stopped for the afternoon ritual around the pot. And there is something innately soothing about dunking a teabag in a cup of hot water, seeing the dark flavor spread like ink. It’s very familiar, but still beautiful.\nSo what about you? Are you a coffee person, a tea person, or a hybrid like me? Is there some other beverage that fuels your creativity or your quiet hours?\nThis entry was posted in Musings, On writing. Bookmark the permalink.\nI am also a hybrid. I love Cuban coffee – my great grandmother used to dunk my pacifier in it – thus the coffee and I have had a long and wonderful relationship.

Of these, 15% have required urgent veterinary treatment and in extreme cases the dogs sadly died from the effects of chocolate poisoning.\nTo prevent the number of dogs that end up visiting the vet with chocolate poisoning, Dogs Trust is today launching its \"Chocs Away\" awareness drive after the survey revealed that 4 in 10 dogs found the chocolate themselves after it was left in easy to find places in the home.\nSadly, many dog owners are simply unaware of the dangers. Over 10% of dogs who ate human chocolate were given the treat by their owners. Easter is a time when we are all tempted to over-indulge, and we might give in to our dogs pleading for a chocolatey treat too. Dogs Trust is advising dog-owners to make sure their four legged friends steer completely clear of chocolate intended for human consumption and instead have to hand some healthy alternatives, such as carrots.\n\"Apart from the risks of obesity and the obvious dangers of eating the foil wrapping, the biggest risk of eating human chocolate is poisoning, resulting in an emergency dash to the vet and sadly even death. Chocolate contains theobromine, which, tolerated by humans, is extremely toxic to man's best friend. The darker the chocolate, the greater the amount of theobromine. Toxic doses vary according to the size of dog and cocoa solid content of the chocolate.\n\"Dogs Trust estimates that 50g of plain chocolate could be enough to kill a small dog, such as a Yorkshire Terrier*, whilst just 400g could be enough to kill an average size dog, so we urge people to make sure they keep treats well out of the reach of pesky paws and make sure children don't share their Easter eggs with their furry friends.\n\"So that your canine companion doesn't feel left out this Easter, we would advise giving them healthy treats such as carrots, cheese or tripe snacks.

The best Os there is and smartphone there is!..\nI really wish the issue of what functionality of BlackBerry 10 would be officially known.\nI understand the app store and other services will stop working but for me, I want to know if I will be able to boot up my phone and use it for Web browsing ( weak browsing by 2020) calls, texts and emails.\nI have a few BlackBerry 10 devices in excellent condition and I would like to use them for streaming music via wifi at the gym, back up emergency device and a 2 phone for when I travel abroad using a local SIM.\nI am fully aware that the BlackBerry 10 experience at that point will be very weak but as a basic device for calls, texts, emails and Web surfing, that is all I would need.\nYes you should get one, if you want a good quality device, then yes for sure.\nmoonflyer and ratfinkstooley like this.\nFor what he wants to use the device for a Passport would work, maybe not 3-4 years but in all honesty I recommend the Passport.\nAbsolutely you should buy the blackberry passport as the nice and awesome design device in the world .\nIs there any inbuilt app for podcast??\nWill that be available after 2020?\nMost things BB10 related will probably not be available after 12/31/2019.\nYou can buy mine if your interested.\n1. Syncing to your laptop may be a problem with BB10.\n2. No one knows if you will be able to use a BB10 device after January 1, 2020.\n3. OG was produced in 2014 and SE was produced in early 2015. Even if 1 and 2 weren't true, there is no guarantee that the non-replaceable battery would last another 3-4 years.\nGiven these potential issues, it would seem that a Passport would not meet your requirements in 2018.\nanyone know when the trade in and trade up programs are rolling out for the bb classic/passport?", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

His season was cut short after seven games.\nWhether or not Patterson will be allowed to play for the Wolverines in 2018 is unclear.\nOle Miss was handed NCAA sanctions due to recruiting infractions recently and the NCAA has permitted the program's senior players to transfer without having to sit out a season. Patterson is a sophomore.\nHowever, a handful of Ole Miss players have alleged they were misled by now former Rebel coach Hugh Freeze and the athletic department during their recruitment about the severity of violations and potential punishment the program was facing.\nOle Miss safety Deontay Anderson, who is also considering a transfer to Michigan, and several other Ole Miss players have retained legal counsel and have petitioned to Ole Miss, the Southeastern Conference and the NCAA for instant transfer eligibility.\nIf Patterson is cleared, he'll be in competition with Michigan redshirt freshman Brandon Peters and true freshman Dylan McCaffrey next year. The Wolverines also are expected to sign quarterback commits Joe Milton and Kevin Doyle for the 2018 recruiting class.\nIf he isn't eligible in 2018, he'd be a redshirt junior starting in 2019.\nPeters became Michigan's third starting quarterback in 2017 after the Wolverines lost Wilton Speight to a vertebrae injury in Week 4 and were forced to sit fifth-year senior John O'Korn due to ineffective play.\nAn Indiana native, Peters threw for 486 yards and four touchdowns in games against Rutgers, Minnesota, Maryland and Wisconsin. He was knocked out of the Wisconsin loss with a concussion, which forced him to miss the regular season finale against Ohio State. Peters has since cleared concussion protocol and is expected to start for the Wolverines in the Outback Bowl against South Carolina on Jan. 1.\nSpeight has announced his decision to take a graduate transfer after this season. Third-year sophomore Alex Malzone also will transfer.\nThe No. 4-ranked player in the 2016 recruiting class and a Toledo native, Patterson committed to Ole Miss roughly two months after Jim Harbaugh became Michigan's head coach in 2015.\nA noted Michigan fan as a youngster, Patterson's grandfather, George Patterson, played in the NBA for the Detroit Pistons. His older brother, Sean, left a quality control job at LSU to join his brother at Ole Miss as a senior player personnel analyst shortly after Patterson committed to the Rebels in 2015.\nAfter sitting out most of his true freshman season, Patterson started Ole Miss' final three games after starter Chad Kelly suffered a season-ending injury. Patterson threw for 880 yards, six touchdowns and three interceptions over those games, and rushed for 169 yards. Ole Miss went 1-2 in those games.\nPatterson won Ole Miss' starting quarterback job out of camp this season, starting the team's first seven games before going down with a torn PCL in October. Ole Miss was 3-4 when Patterson suffered the knee injury.\nJunior quarterback Jordan Ta'amu went 3-2 for the Rebels in place of Patterson, throwing for 1,682 yards, 11 touchdowns and four interceptions.\nPatterson was on campus last weekend along with Anderson and Ole Miss receiver Van Jefferson. All three were joined by the entire Michigan coaching staff, including coach Jim Harbaugh, at the Crisler Center for the Wolverines' overtime win over UCLA on Saturday afternoon.\nSeveral Michigan players were on hand to mingle with Patterson and company. Many have been asked over the past week for their thoughts on Harbaugh's decision to entertain transfers.\nAnd whether or not any of them might feel threatened by an outside player coming into the program to compete for their spots.\n\"More competition makes each other better,\" said freshman center Cesar Ruiz, who was Patterson's prep quarterback at IMG Academy. \"I don't think anyone feels threatened.\"", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

First Luule published a little booklet called “Love, Forgiveness and health”, but very soon she realized that she need to go deeper with the explanation, because more and more people visited her with same questions and problems. So at the year 1994 first book – “A teaching of Survival I” was published.\nVery soon the books were translated to Russian, Latvian and Finnish. Luule gave lecturers and received patients also in English speaking countries like USA, Canada and Great Britain, but since she didn’t speak English herself, she was lecturing mainly to the local Estonians or was translated by someone who knew Estonian. That is probably why the first and only English edition had to wait until year 1997. “A Teaching of Survival” in English was compiled out of the two original books: first and second in the series.\nPerhaps this combination of two books was one of the obstacles why English edition never became so popular as translations to Russian, Finnish or other languages. The book which has more than 500 pages and a few graphics is probably too “heavy” for a regular reader interested in an easy way to get the good health.\nThese books can be classified as self-help books, with an accent on the spiritual and mental, essentially addressed to people interested in self-help but holding potentiality of arousing attention of a much broader circle of readers. Their main topic is the basic connection between human thoughts, different stresses and illnesses. To our knowledge, there is no similar book in the world which, by using examples from everyday life, explains and interprets different stresses and describes how they lead to specific illnesses. The books are rich in clear and detailed graphs and tables, illustrating those ideas. What is so remarkable about this approach is that it makes a connection between different stresses and their end-result ­– specific illnesses, showing which stress leads to which illness. This is exactly where “A Teaching of Survival” is different from other spiritual/mental teachings. Where the majority of spiritual systems just point out the connection between thoughts and stress, “A Teaching of Survival” aims deeper by offering a detailed system of thought. It deals with the most basic level of the human being – the physical body – and explains the mental and spiritual causes for all commonly known illnesses.\nThe first book – out of a total of eight (8) books – was published in Estonia in 1994. It gained fast and surprising popularity and beat all Estonian book sales records. The rest of the books in the series were published at a run up to 2004. Very soon the books were translated to Russian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Czech, Finnish, Bulgarian. Moreover, there’s an interest for translating the book in German and Hebrew too. The books are extremely popular in Russia where even some schools have been established applying the same methodology/teaching. Luule herself gave lectures and received patients also in English speaking countries like USA, Canada and Great Britain. “A Teaching of Survival” in English was compiled in Estonia in year 1997 out of the two original books: first and second in the series. The English version that we submit for your evaluation consists of 574 pages with several tables and graphs and it was translated by a native speaker and edited by an English-speaking editor.\nLuule Viilma died in 2002. Her family continues to keep and spread her legacy. Our aim is to have all eight (8) books published for the English language reader. We have had lots of positive feedback from all around the world that encourages us to offer the series to a larger circle of readers.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

But electrically shocked animals are prohibited unanimously.\n· Animals and poultry slaughtered by people of earlier revelations.\n· The food of people of earlier revelations.\nCan a Muslim eat of the meat of animals slaughtered by non-Muslims who belong to earlier divine religions in countries where the Muslim community is in a minority, especially when these are offered in shops and restaurants?\nWe need to go into the details of this question.\nThis means that Muslims who visit or are resident in non-Muslim countries may eat the meat of animals slaughtered by people of earlier revelation, if such animals are lawful to eat. However, they need to make sure that nothing is added to them which is forbidden in Islam. In addition, if one is sure that the animal has not been properly slaughtered then the permissibility is cancelled.\n1. Peoples of other religions, like Buddhists, Sikhs and polytheists may be living among them.\n2. The normal practice in their slaughterhouses is unlike the proper Islamic method. The Qur’anic verse relates to what the followers of earlier religions used to do during the Prophet’s lifetime, when they slaughtered their animals in the same way as Muslims.\n3. The right thing is to take a cautious attitude so that we do not eat meat unless we know that it is properly slaughtered.\nThe late Shaikh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baz said that scholars of the first view may reply that God knew perfectly well what will happen in the future, yet He stated a general rule: ‘The food of those who were given revelations is lawful for you.\nIn his collected Fatwas, Shaikh Ibn Baz said: ‘I have been informed by many residents there that most slaughterhouses in America and Europe do not follow the Islamic way of slaughter. Therefore, if a Muslim takes the precaution of not eating of such meat, that is preferable. It is important that a believer should take a cautious approach with matters related to food and drink. If he can buy a sheep or chicken and slaughter it by himself or if he buys it from butchers that are known to sell only properly slaughtered meat, this is much better.\nScholars who subscribe to the second view may also say that these people are not followers of earlier revelations. They do not show respect for their faith or keenness to follow its teachings.\nIf such meat is sold in an area populated by people of earlier divine religions only, i.e. Jews and Christians, their meat is permissible to eat even though the method of their slaughter is unknown. If other unbelievers live in the same area such meat should not be eaten, because what is permissible is mixed with what is not permissible, unless we know that the slaughter is carried out in the appropriate method.\nIf it is known that the method of slaughter is unacceptable from the Islamic point of view, as in the case of strangulation or electric shock, then the meat is not permissible to eat, even if the slaughterer is a Muslim.\nThis is the view of the Permanent Committee for Research and Fatwa, the International Islamic Fiqh Academy and the European Council for Fatwa and Research, as expressed in its third session. It is also the view of Shaikh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baz and Shaikh Muhammad ibn Uthaymeen.\nAll institutions and councils are almost unanimous that the meat of animals known to have been killed by electric shock is unlawful to eat, because then they are carrion. To carry out slaughter on such animals after they have died is meaningless. The decision by the European Council for Fatwa and Research states: ‘Having reviewed the different methods of slaughter and identified the different unacceptable details such methods involve, leading to a large number of such animals, particularly chickens, dying, the Council rules that it is unlawful to eat the meat of poultry and bovine animals. This does not apply to lamb and veal because their method of slaughter in some countries is not unacceptable. The Council recommends the Muslim community in Western countries to establish their own slaughterhouses so that they can be reassured and preserve their own religious and cultural identity. The Council calls on Western countries to acknowledge the religious requirements of Muslims and enable them to slaughter their animals in accordance with the Islamic faith, as they do with other religious communities such as the Jews. The Council recommends Muslim countries to import only permissible meat which is slaughtered under supervision of reliable Muslim centres in Western countries.\nThe decision by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy concludes that the normal way to slaughter poultry and other animals is manually by the butcher. There is no harm in using machines provided the Islamic conditions are met. Mentioning God’s name once for every group of animals that are slaughtered in succession is sufficient, but if there is disruption, the name of God must be mentioned again.\nGod has permitted eating the food of the people of earlier divine religions.\nTherefore, such food may be eaten by Muslims, unless we have a reason that makes it unlawful for us to eat.\nScholars are unanimous that the food of earlier divine religions is lawful for Muslims to eat.\nWhere there is doubt, then the meat should not be eaten.\n· Fatawa by The Permanent Committee for Research and Fatwa.\n· Decisions of the European Council for Fatwa and Research.\n· Decisions by the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League.\n· Fatawa for Muslim minorities by a group of scholars.\n· The Collected Fatwas by Shaikh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baz.\n· Mut’ib al-Qahtani (ed.), Is[af al-Mughtaribin bi Fatawa al-[Ulama’ al-Rabbaniyyin.\n· Abdullah Bin Bayyah, Sina[at al-Fatwa wa Fiqh al-Aqaliyyat.\n· Khalid Abd al-Qadir, Min Fiqh al-Aqaliyyat, Kitab al-Ummah, No. 61.\nFatawa by the Permanent Committee for Research and Fatwa, vol. 22, pp. 387–397, 411, 412 and 418; The International Islamic Fiqh Council, Decision 23 (11/3) and 24 (3/10); the European Council for Fatwa and Research; Ibn Baz, Fatawa, vol. 23, pp. 10–21 and 83; Ibn Uthaimeen, Fatawa al-Aqaliyyat al-Muslimah, pp. 97 and 99.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

How this situation came to be and what can be done to get out of it, explains Ivan Blo in his interview to Lenta.ru. He is a former general director and responsible for anti-terrorist activities in the Ministry of Interior of France. Today Mr. Blo is an adviser for political affairs and security issues to the former President of France Nicolas Sarkozy.\nMr. Blo, why is it that the French secret services, which are considered among the most efficient in the world, are losing the battle with the terrorists?\nThe French secret services, where I worked for many years, are in good condition now and are working effectively. The problem is that the amount of potential extremists has increased sharply. Europol spoke of about 3,000 people in the EU. And these are just people willing to personally commit a terrorist act, but they have many supporters and helpers who also need to be monitored and controlled. At this stage the number of officers in the special services is numerous, but if illegal immigration continues, they will need to monitor many more suspects. We shouldn’t separate the problems of uncontrolled migration and terrorism. In Poland or Hungary where migrants are not accepted, a terrorist act has not been committed.\nHow were so many systematic errors compounded in the security systems of France?\nIn my last book, which I wrote with counterterrorism specialist Roger Marion, we explain that the government should be more flexible and should work proactively rather than go after the events. It is also necessary to use the military forces which generally stay away from these processes. Earlier, it was commonly believed that in the fight against terrorism we should rely exclusively on the police, but today we already are in a state of war and things are different.\nHow effective are the government’s measures to strengthen the safety of France? For example, summoning reservists, increasing the number of employees of the police and gendarmerie, etc.?\nThese measures are already late. Mobilization of reservists and the participation of volunteers should have happened much earlier. Personally, I think that now we need to create a true National Guard, as Russia did. We had such a guard from 1789 to 1872. Within such a structure civilians can be attracted to participate in police operations and combat actions.\nAfter the terrorist act in Nice, President Hollande said that France will respond to this crime with new strikes on the terrorists from the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Do you share the optimism of the president that in such a way, the level of terrorist threat in the country can be reduced?\nWe should fight seriously in Iraq and Syria, as Russia does. But that can not reduce the threat level inside the country. Communist leader Mao Zedong said that a good revolutionary must feel among the people, like a fish in water. The same is now true for terrorists. They feel completely at ease within the immigrant-Muslim communities. Of course, not all Muslims support terrorists, but opinion polls show that 30% of people in the Muslim community are understanding of them and even support their actions. These are 1.5 million people (in France there are about 7.5 million Muslims). No need for them to be a terrorist, but it is certain that if they need help, it will be there. The trouble is that France has long stopped dealing with migration issues. It stopped to integrate Muslims entering the country and instilling in them a love of the new homeland. Today, both the left and right will pay for this political error. The President of France, is not very serious in regard to this internal problem that has enormous significance for the country. We let a Trojan horse enter France, exactly as described in the Greek epic.\nDo you think its possible to identify potential terrorists among the migrants, and to take measures against them?\nIt is impossible to determine who is a “real terrorist”. These may include not only those who have committed murder, but many others that were previously peaceful and quiet, and one day become terrorists in a flash. These are the so to speak, “domesticated wolves” who usually lead a quiet and peaceful life and no one can know at which point they will drastically alter their behavior. Nazi agents were called “domesticated wolves” in Paris during World War II, who before the war led a quiet life, and when the war started, switched to active actions against their own country. It is impossible to calculate how many radicalized Islamic terrorists there actually are. We’re dealing with fighters, revolutionaries, who have accepted the new form of Islam, which drastically differs from traditional Islam. The names of the founders and ideologists of this new form of Islamic revolutionary movement are known – these are the Egyptian professor Sayyid Qutb, who planned the murder of Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser (President of Egypt 1956), for which he received a death sentence, and Pakistani professor Al Maududi who died in the US. These two professors are the Marx and Engels of Islamism. But today no one mentions them, although their school created the leaders of “Al Qaeda” Osama bin Laden and al-Zarqawi, who later educated the “caliph” of the Islamic State Al Baghdadi. Reread “The Possessed” Dostoevsky. He has described the mentality of fanatical fighters very well. A revolutionary is a man devoid of emotions, possessing a cool mind that justifies murder and despises human feelings.\nIn many European countries there are strict laws governing arms sales. However, terrorists easily procure such. How does that work?\nOnly honest and law-abiding citizens respect laws. But the bandits from the suburbs have always secured weapons very easily. I’m talking about illegal trafficking. And in Western countries opportunities for such traffic are unlimited. I must say that the lack of security became a reality in the West after 1968, when the so-called “Bourgeois” morality collapsed. From that moment on, the number of crimes in France annually grew, reaching 4.5 million this year. This reflects on the conflict between ordinary people who do not feel safe, and wealthy power elites, including the political elite, who find pleasure in the justification of crime.\nWill the influx of terrorist activity lead to an increase in Islamophobia, and as a consequence increase inter-religious and inter-ethnic clashes in the country?\nOf course, there is a risk of conflict, especially between supporters of secularism and the secular state, and Muslims respectively. But Catholics have lost their militancy a long time ago. Therefore, an ethic conflict is more likely than a religious one. The non-indigenous population of Arabs serve as a source of ever-increasing tension. According to the French Institute for the Study of Public Opinion (IFOP), in April 2016, 68% of respondents believe that Muslims or immigrants of Islamic origin are barely integrated into society; 67% are convinced that they really do not want to integrate; 45% of French people claim that the cultural differences with Muslims are so large that they can not be a peaceful coexistence; and only 14% of respondents say that the problems in inter-ethnic relations are due to the racist prejudices of the French. Notably, however, even this small percentage is declining. Already in the 1973 report of the National Commission of Human Rights, 74% of French people thought that the number of immigrants in the country was too big. By the government had no reaction to this conclusion because of the total absence of patriotism in them. Elites do not realize that the situation is already explosive. And even if emigration from the countries of Africa and the Middle East are stopped, we must find opportunities for the extradition of migrants from the country. Every year, this leads to a dangerous increase in the potential of inter-ethnic confrontation in the country.\nHow is the extraordinary security situation influencing the country? Will you stay in this mode permanently? Are the French ready to radically change their lifestyle? Israel has lived for many years under conditions of maximum security measures, which sometimes require limiting the freedoms of citizens. Will the French agree to such measures?\nThe state of emergency does not affect the ordinary Frenchman. It facilitates the ability of the police to conduct searches, but the population is reacting calmly toward these measures. France today is still a far cry from the situation in Israel.\nAfter the terrorist attacks last November, French society bonded and the President’s rating reached 30%. Just days ago, however, at a funeral ceremony in Nice, the Prime Minister Manuel Valls was booed. What is the reason for this change of public sentiment in France?\nPresident Hollande’s popularity is falling and this does not depend only on terrorism. The economy stagnated. The unemployment rate does not fall below 10%, while with 20-25-year-olds it reached 25%. Right-wing political forces are furious and the left are disappointed. The ultra-left organize strikes and demonstrations. There is no radical change in sentiment, but the opinion of the authorities, particularly among the poor, is deteriorating. They say that those in power have betrayed them. The majority of voters who voted for the Communists earlier on, went into the camp of the National Front. Understandably, many people in the country are convinced that today’s government is ineffective, both in the fight against terrorism and in dealing with illegal migration. They consider the French government today to be a “rag”, it has no authority. The population lives with the feeling that oligarchy manages them, which laughs at public opinion and despised true democracy.\nWhat do you think should be done now to prevent the threat of new terrorist acts?\nTo restore patriotic education and learning of French history for all citizens, without exception, starting with students.\nTo restore conscription in the army, canceled by President Jacques Chirac.\nTo create a National Guard, which would include volunteers, to enable the population to participate in the preservation of public order and protection of external borders.\nTo create a broad international anti-terrorism alliance with Russia.\nWhat prevents the special services of EU countries, such as France and Belgium, from coordinating their activities? Do we need a unification of the laws?\nInter-state coordination of European secret services is limited because national security authorities do not trust their foreign counterparts. Roughly speaking, trust in everything, which concerns common European processes, was undermined when the European Commission’s Juncker, made EU governments to accept immigrant quotas under the threat of financial penalties, completely ignoring public opinion in European countries. So here the problem is not in unification of legislation, but the growing animosity towards the EU as an anti-democratic institution. We could take Israel as an example. They show how an independent country can be much more effective in fighting terrorism, than many weak countries in a union.\nMany terrorists have historically fell within the sight of the special services. How is it that control is weakening and even more crimes are committed?\nIn the current state of the secret services, it is difficult to control the increased number of suspected terrorists. New waves of migrants only increase the number of suspects. On the other hand, training of new employees of the security services requires at least two years. Such training becomes meaningless, because each year migrants continue to arrive.\nImmigration is Terrorism. In fact, according to UN law, it is more then just simple terrorism, it is in fact genocide and ethnic cleansing through racial-replacement.

Illustrator Lucy Irving created wooden artwork of the giant goat, animator Mark Billington animated a loop which was projected in the cave, and animator Stew Harvey helped to design the track layout, goats and artwork the trees.\nThe environment, created using paper craft techniques, cut wood and lots of spray paint, tells the the abstract narrative of a demon goat. Beginning in an alpine forest populated by mountain goats, the train moves into a sinister cave. Here we see a goat staring into a glowing light who is then transformed into the goat beast. Exiting the cave we see the once lush forest decimated and stripped, and as we climb the mountain side goats are running away downhill. We travel across the top of the mountain to see that the cave is below an ancient altar of doom surrounded by bones. In the distance we can see the enormous cause of this destruction; a giant goat beast who finally devours us.\nParticipants of the event were first invited to take a look at the ride in person, waving and gesturing at the camera as it moved though the landscape.

I have seen some lathes that are new that have movement in the saddle but obviously as the lathe wears you get more movement. I know some of the Mini Lathes do have adjusting screws on the shear plates at the front & rear of the saddle to take any up & down movement out from the saddle. How is this addressed on larger lathes for example on the Warco WM 180, 240,250, 280 etc that don't appear to have any way of doing this, look forward to your opinions & thanks Martin.\nWhy do a lot of the Chinese lathes that we use don't have any way of adjusting the saddle to bed ways, talking about up & down or rocking movement of the saddle.\nSimple - it's all down to cost. Essential given that many people buy on price, not utility.\nI would have thought the saddle wouldn't need any adjustment given it slides along twin vee bedways (on a WM280). At the rear of the saddle there is a block with 4 allen bolts, which I think keeps the saddle from lifting up.\nWell it could be that they are said to be based on Emco designs and if the Emco that I had was anything to go by I did not have any reason to want to adjust the carrage in the 25yrs I owned it and it came to me at least 2nd hand.\nSame with my 280 which I've had for 10years now and don't feel any need to go looking at the fit of carrage to ways and mine probably gets a lot more use than most.\nIt just seems an area that you cant adjust re any chatter you may get especially on some smaller machines like a Warco WM 180 that dosn't have a lot of weight to the saddle/apron/cross slide/compound assembly. I know even on Mini lathes that do have adjusters some like Steve Jordan on Youtube mod these saddles further still to improve & eliminate movement further.\nIf you have a lathe that has V-ways and the saddle is rocking then it needs a regrind, either due to wear or it was never right in the first place.\nLift is slightly easier, might be a case of removing shims etc but there is a way to adjust it. Plenty of vids on YouTube of UK and US mini lathe users performing saddle mods to stop lift, mostly during parting off.\nIt is lift i am referring to & not any wear on the ways or saddle ( new machines ), most of these machines don't appear to have any shims between the saddle & shear plates to remove or re shim as the shear plates are bolted on with excess clearance to the ways in some cases.\nIt would not be difficult to mill a bit off the plate where it bolts to the underside of the saddle but leave full thickness where it goes under the bed if you felt the need. Same result as removing shims.\nYes that was the easiest why i had thought as well, possibly over cut when milling the shear plate then using appropriate shims to fine tune along the shear plates length.\nOn the WM280 the shear plate does not have much clearance, at least not on mine. If I tightened the four allen screws which attach the plate to the saddle, the saddle would bind on the bed. So the shear plate is sort of adjustable just like a gib, tighten it until the drag of the saddle to the bed feels right and there's no up and down movement.\nSaddle should not rock when new.\nMost far-Eastern lathes have American style inverted-V + flat bedways that tend to become a better fit with wear, unlike flat bed lathes that become loose as the shears wear.\nMini-lathes and the SC4 all have adjustable plates under the shears to stop the carriage rising, I'm sure you will find these on most Chinese (and other) lathes.

The contract resulted from the recommendation of hospital experts serving on one of Vizient's member-led councils. Vizient, the largest member-driven health care performance improvement company in the US, awards Innovative Technology contracts to companies with technologies that demonstrate an ability to enhance clinical care or patient safety, and those that improve an organization's care delivery and business model.\nDebbie Archer, procurement director and leader of Vizient's Innovative Technology program for suppliers said, \"Due to the number of products and services being released and marketed as 'innovative,' our member hospitals value the thorough review process in place at Vizient to help them identify products worth further evaluation at their own facilities. After a full review of the Carnation Ambulatory Monitor, Vizient's member council agreed this solution offers unique and incremental benefit over other available products on the market today and recommended it for an Innovative Technology contract. We are pleased to award this new contract to Bardy Diagnostics.\"\nUnlike other cardiac patch monitors on the market, the CAM is the first ambulatory ECG monitor with high fidelity, novel detection technology that reliably records the P-wave, the small amplitude ECG signal that is essential to accurate arrhythmia diagnosis and the determination of appropriate medical treatments or procedural interventions. CAM reporting is enabled by BDxCONNECT, a cloud-based ECG analysis and patient management portal that can be tailored to support different clinical workflows and the care delivery needs and business model of a specific provider or health system.\n\"We are delighted that Vizient's member-led council selected the CAM for an Innovative Technology contract. We look forward to working with Vizient's diverse membership to develop strong relationships that will improve patient outcomes with the use of our CAM patch and monitoring services,\" said Ken Nelson, Chief Commercial Officer of Bardy Diagnostics.\nCommenting on the novel attributes of the CAM, BDx Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Gust H. Bardy, MD, remarked, \"Our P-wave centric CAM recordings are distilled into clinically-actionable data represented in a proprietary report format incorporating beat-to-beat R-R interval plots – a feature not available with any other product or service. We appreciate the recognition and distribution opportunity offered by Vizient and its members.\"\nVizient, Inc. represents the combined strengths of the organizations formerly known as VHA Inc., University HealthSystem Consortium, Novation, and MedAssets' Spend and Clinical Resource Management. Since 2003, nearly 2200 new and innovative products and technologies have been submitted through the Vizient Innovative Technology program. Vizient works with member-led councils and task forces to identify and review potentially innovative products. If it is determined that a product is innovative, a contract may be awarded outside of Vizient's competitive bid cycle.\nBardy Diagnostics, Inc. is an innovator in digital health and remote patient monitoring, with a focus on providing diagnostically-accurate and patient-friendly cardiac patch and other monitors to the industry. The company's CAM patch is a non-invasive, P-wave centric™ ambulatory cardiac monitor and arrhythmia detection device that is designed to improve patient compliance for adults and children through its lifestyle-enabling design. Designed to be worn comfortably and discreetly, the female-friendly, hourglass-shaped CAM patch is placed on the center of the chest, directly over the heart for optimum ECG signal collection. The proprietary technology of the CAM patch provides optimal detection and clear recording of the often difficult-to-detect P-wave, the signal of the ECG waveform that is essential for accurate arrhythmia diagnosis.

This is not a project to be taken lightly especially if you want professional results. A home needs to be properly planned, built and designed to ensure that it is both attractive and functional. A renovation project can help to improve or update the home by creating spaces that look better and make the home more comfortable. To achieve the best basement development results, it is important to make extensive preparations on different factors before the project begins.\nIf you live in Calgary, you can get reliable basement developers to work on your project. The best development companies have the expertise and experience to make sure that you get the best results. As a homeowner, working with a trustworthy company will mean that you have the help that you need to accomplish your dreams. If you have no idea where to start, the professionals will guide you through the process, giving your ideas and tips that will be very helpful before and during the process.\nPreparing properly is essential before any building project. Before the project begins, you will need to obtain permits and think about factors like electricity, plumbing and the entire construction. You have to consider all the factors to ensure that the project goes smoothly. Taking care of all the details in advance will mean that you do not have to experience delays and stoppages. When you decide how to use the basement, take time to prepare to ensure that the construction process is smooth until completion. To avoid unnecessary headaches, you should not start until you are sure that everything is in place.\nYou can save yourself a lot of stress by coming up with a plan that is doable and flexible. Do not try to implement an unrealistic plan unless you want to end up with a half-completed project. Make sure that you have the ability to implement the plan to its completion. A well thought-out plan should be flexible to some modifications, just in case something happens and you have to change course. Issues like lack of preferred materials, unavailable personnel and weather disturbances can affect the project. It is important to be able to make adjustments while ensuring good budget management.\nThe people you hire to work on the development project will determine the results that you get. Take your time to choose a company that is reliable and trustworthy. Working with the right manpower will mean that you do not have to wonder if you are getting the best service. It is important to keep communication channels direct and open when dealing with the construction company. The people on the project should have a clear idea on what you expect or how you want the basement to look like. Relay your expectations to the people working on the project regarding structures and designs.\nPlanning your basement construction project does not have to be complicated. There are ways to ensure that you plan a dream renovation project. A well thought-out construction plan will be easy to understand and follow. The developers require detailed procedures before they commence the project or actual construction; but fortunately, experienced professionals have learnt the ropes over time. A good Calgary basement development company will provide assistance throughout the planning process. This will help you to overcome any uncertainties that you may have.\nWhen developing your basement, you need to understand that there are no fixed rules about how you can use the space. You have the freedom to create your dream basement and there is no right or wrong preference. Remember that you are the one who will use the renovated basement. No one should convince you to turn the space into a home theatre when what you really want is a gym or hobby room! When planning the project, after the building permits have been obtained, talk to your family and agree on how you want to use the space. The outcome of your project will depend on your preferences.\nConstructing a basement can be a complex process and you should make sure that you listen to expert advice and rely on professional expertise. Get as much information as you can about enhancing a basement. The more knowledge you have, the easier it will be to make the best plans. You can get ideas from the internet, magazines and other sources. By getting different ideas, you can come up with a theme that will ensure that you have the basement of your choice.

A simple DUI may be a first-time offense, which may not render a significant impact on the status of an individual’s immigration as a more serious DUI. A more serious DUI may involve reckless driving, an accident causing injury or death of another or a longer history of DUI convictions.\nThe nature of immigration proceedings an immigrant is passing through influences the impact of a conviction. For instance, the application may be denied when the person is seeking adjustment of status to permanent residency. Also, an argument may be made to have a person who has not been in immigration proceedings removed from the US.\nA DUI can be the grounds for determining an immigrant being removable or inadmissible when it establishes a controlled substances conviction. It can occur when the convicted was under the influence of drugs rather than alcohol at the time of arrest.\nIn certain cases, a DUI conviction may result in the loss of job of the convicted individual. This may occur when the position involves driving, court time that affects duty hours or the conviction is contrary to the company policies. In addition, an immigrant may lose the visa when their status is based on employment.\nA DUI can result in a negative discretionary factor with the loss of discretionary immigration benefits.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

The youngsters use the bench at night as meetingpoint. This has inspired the artist Christian Elovara Dinesen to perform the bench with LED-light, so it lights up in the dark. The performance is done in co-lab with the youngsters from Fåborg-Midtfyns production-school. Together they have tuned the bench, themselves and their rides in a magical way. The contrast between the classic bench and the futuristic techno light is both funny and strong, and creates new life to the art-bench in Ringe.

It runs throughout November 2018 in 7 cities in Denmark and on social medie. The aim of the campaign is to bring art into everyday life and engage the recipients in an eye-leveled conversation about its affect and value.\nThe main vision of #VærkdinVerden is to bring increased attention to art in public space, and provide a framework that generates numerous perspectives and stories on the art that surrounds us. 8 artists produce new art works for the exhibition involving short some-videos, performances, parties, apps, encouragements, interventions, modified and new statements on art, and a lot more. Each artwork will enter in to dialogue with 7 existing public art sites across Denmark and be produced in collaboration with its users.\nThe 8 participating artists are: Tanja Nellemann Poulsen, Christian Elovara Dinesen, Kristoffer Akselbo, Charlotte Haslund-Christensen, Jacob Tækker, Within Walls, Jens & Morten og Lars Arrhenius.\n#VærkdinVerden happens November 1 to November 30, 2018.\nWhat would a work of art tell us if it could speak?

They will have different personalities and therefore different ideas about how to do their jobs. If you are a manager, it is important to recognise this because having a deep understanding of people is worth its weight in gold. If you can enable each employee to channel their strengths and shine in a way that benefits your business, then you are on the right track.\nHere are some tips on turning a group of individuals into a cohesive, successful team that will help your business reach its full potential.\nStart by setting the scene for your employees. Let them know what they are aiming for and help them to understand the goals of your company.\nTalk about the culture you want to buildPlant the seeds of your business culture in your workers’ minds so it grows and flourishes. Get them excited about being part of the team and the environment.\nDescribe your plansCreate a vision of where your team should be, six months, a year and two years from now. Use Xero Accounting Software to draw up realistic financial forecasts and share these with your employees.\nExplain the environment of customers, prospects, and partnersUse diagrams if necessary to show the interaction between all the people around your company.\nUse ‘we’ instead of ‘I’ when talking about your businessIt is a typical startup mistake to associate yourself with your business, but if you want your employees to feel part of a team, then you will need to include them too.\nThese points will help your employees feel settled and give them a feeling for the situation in which they are working. Once that is done, you can start to bring out the best in them.\nIt is important to quickly get your employees involved in the day-to-day running of your business. Keep them active and use their strengths to help them integrate and develop.\nGive them tasks right awayOn the first day, your new employees should already be doing useful work. Get them engaged right from the start.\nChallenge themHelp your employees to push themselves. Use timelines or specific goals (with their input) for them to strive for.\nAcknowledge their successesUse the carrot, not just the stick. Always reward success with praise.\nMentor your new hiresPartner your new employees with someone senior on the team. The more mentoring you do, the faster your team will take shape.\nEveryone needs to know their job – what’s expected of them and what’s not. If you do not make this clear, the morale of your employees will suffer, and progress and efficiency will be affected.\nFor example, if one person is waiting for another to finish a task, but the other person does not believe that task is part of their job description, progress will grind to a halt.\nSo be sure to update roles and task lists frequently. Then your employees will know what they are supposed to be doing.\nBudget carefullyDays off work will cost you money in terms of lost productivity, plus the cost of the team-building event itself. Xero Accounting Software will keep your accounts up to date, so you can see at a glance what you can afford.\nExamine all the optionsPaintballing? Go-karting? Building log bridges over rivers? Ask your employees which options they might prefer, but be prepared for many different answers.\nDon’t forget the simple thingsSomething as low key as providing drinks and snacks for the last hour of a Friday afternoon might work well. Not everyone wants to crawl through the undergrowth in camouflage clothing.\nComplementary skill sets can mean contrasting personalities. For example (as a general rule only), salespeople tend to be extroverts while programmers and developers tend to be more introverted. That reflects the type of person drawn to each role and also the demands of the role itself.\nTrying to ‘fix’ these differences, so everyone’s the same will not work. In fact, it is likely to backfire badly. At best you will annoy your employees, at worst you will breach diversity and equality legislation.\nAsk guest speakers to meet with your teamTalks on anything from organisational psychology to technical matters can help inform your team and improve their skills.\nShare development ideas with customers and key business partnersIf you are gearing up for major investment, make sure your customers and business partners are ready for it. Get your staff involved in these discussions.\nInvite customers and key partners to staff meetingsGive them the chance to provide feedback and take questions from your team. Do this carefully to avoid giving out confidential business information.\nHave a team coachConsider using the services of someone who can provide real-time feedback on how your team is working together.\nGetting an outside perspective can also help prevent ‘groupthink’, where employees become subdued and unwilling to challenge the norms of your business. Keep your staff thinking positively and creatively at all times.\nShow them you careLearn about things like their family, personal life or hobbies.\nFocus on personal growthThink about enhancing your employees’ skill-sets and management skills. Know their career goals and help them get there.\nInvest in your employeesGive them the support and tools they need to be successful. This could include things like a healthy working environment, a supportive team or the right software or technical equipment.\nCelebrate the little victories!Reward every success, no matter how small it might seem. The goodwill generated will pay you back many times over.\nBe positive and stay positiveDon’t lose your cool or lose control, as that will set a bad impression and affect morale.\nIn this situation, you must tread carefully and follow all local laws, especially those relating to privacy and employment rights. Seek professional advice if necessary.\nSometimes people just won’t fit into your culture, which is again why making the right employee choice is so important. Firing people should be a last resort if you have tried every other option including third-party mediation services and verbal and written warnings. Be sure to follow local legislation if you are forced to take this option.\nInability to work togetherUsually due to personality clashes. Resolving these is one of the hardest tasks for management.\nToo many individual projectsPeople who like to excel will feel unmotivated if they have to spread their abilities widely.\nToo much individual recognitionFavouring some team members above others will cause resentment.\nCompeting agendasIf there’s a lack of consensus, productivity will drop.\nTop-down talk and micro-managementSaying “Do this, do that” is usually less efficient than setting a goal and letting the team achieve it on their own.\nFor your team to thrive, you must be approachable, friendly, authoritative and responsible. In other words, a good manager and leader.\nYou may need the training to help you become a better manager, and there’s no shame in that. Running a business is a learning process – and just like your employees, you can learn and improve.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

Mike Teska, Product Line Manager at SKF, explains.\nMotors are being asked to work with less margin and cost these days, so it’s no surprise when they occasionally fail. Around 40% of these failures are caused by problems with the bearings. For this reason, it makes perfect sense that many companies use predictive maintenance (PdM) techniques to keep a constant check on bearing health.\nTechniques such as vibration monitoring and thermal monitoring help to spot problems at the earliest opportunity, preventing small problems turning into large ones: better to prevent motor bearing failure than be forced to fix it later.\nA further 40% of motor failures – even higher for motors operating above 4kV – are caused by insulation problems such as coil windings in the motor or loose connections. Despite this, PdM to detect insulation weakness is not as commonly used. A ground wall insulation test using a ‘megger’ test is quite common, but is not a very good or complete test.\nThe problems caused by insulation weakness – such as catastrophic motor failure, or even plant fires – can be just as serious as those caused by worn bearings or overheating. For this reason, it is important to have a way of assessing insulation strength – and take action in good time.\nThere are two types of insulation in an electric motor, groundwall and winding. Groundwall insulation is found between the motor stator and the electrical windings. The insulation strength of new groundwall insulation is very high, often 40 times operating voltage. Winding insulation is the thin insulation on the wires used in the motor windings. The insulation strength of new winding insulation is about 15 times operating voltage. Most motor insulation failures start as winding insulation failures since that insulation strength is so much weaker. When a winding insulation failure occurs, the motor can fail quickly, often becoming so hot as to also damage the groundwall insulation and create a groundwall insulation failure.\nAutomated motor insulation testing, using a device like the SKF Baker AWA-IV, makes insulation testing “push button” easy, helps to remove operator error and inconsistency.\nStatic insulation testing is carried out with the motor disconnected from the power supply, and is typically performed from the motor control cabinet. Testing from the MCC also allows detection of electrical faults outside the motor itself – such as in junction boxes or feeder cables.\n• Meg-ohm test: this test is run below the operating voltage of the motor and shows if the motor groundwall insulation has failed, or is wet or contaminated.\n• Polarization Index (PI) test: this is a 10-minute test of the ground wall insulation. The test voltage is held steady for 10 minutes, and the ratio of the insulation resistance at 10 minutes and a 1 minute is calculated. Strong groundwall insulation will have a PI value greater than 2.\n• DC step voltage test: in this groundwall insulation test, the voltage begins at or below the operating voltage and then is increased in several steps to double the line voltage, plus 1000V. Voltage is increased in five or more steps – dwelling at each voltage step for 1 minute. Good insulation will show a linear increase of current with each voltage step, while insulation weakness is revealed by non-linearity in the current increases.\n• Hipot test: This is the groundwall insulation resistance in meg ohms at 2 x line voltage + 1000V.\nThe preceding tests have all tested the groundwall insulation, but the winding insulation is the most prone to failure. The surge test focuses on the winding insulation.\n• Surge test: determines turn-to-turn, coil-to-coil and phase-to-phase insulation condition. It injects fast rise time voltage pulses into each phase and analyses the resultant sine waves. The surge test results can identify winding shorts, or high resistance connections or imbalances. If the waveform shifts frequency during the surge test, this is an indication of winding insulation weakness. SKF Static Motor Analyzers automatically analyse the surge waveform.\nStatic test results are clear and unambiguous, and produce a specific result that requires little interpretation.\nAs well as giving a clear output, these results can be trended over time. This allows operators or maintenance managers to assess the progress of a potential condition over time. For instance, if a step voltage shows increasing non-linearity, this suggests a weakening of the groundwall insulation.\nThese tests can have a critical effect on productivity and profits. At a leading pulp and paper company, technicians began using SKF Baker AWA-IV testers to identify problems in about 800 motor systems.\n• A cable shorted to ground in starter, and a pinhole in the cable (found after failing surge test and step voltage test).\nIn all, the company cut its annual motor costs by nearly one-third after it started using SKF Baker testing rigs.\nA number of other real-life examples illustrate the financial benefit of assessing insulation strength properly.\nA steel mill in Australiahad a 6.6kV pump motor that required maintenance – including a rewind. The motor was rewound at a motor shop, then transferred to a second facility 800km away, for vacuum pressure impregnation (VPI). A surge test indicated that insulation strength was still not right. The motor was then put onto a test stand and run. Motor currents and vibration tests were OK so – because the mill was in a hurry to resume production – the motor was put back into service. It failed catastrophically after three days, causing a fire. The reason was traced to the windings – which had probably been damaged in transit to or from the VPI facility. The surge test picked up on the problem, but had been discounted.\nThis shows that tests for insulation strength are ‘real’ – and are ignored at the user’s peril. If vibration monitoring indicates that a bearing is starting to fail, it is replaced – and the same should happen with insulation.\nThese are all examples of static testing of motor insulation – where the motor is disconnected from its power source and tested separately. This identifies problems within the motor. However, motors can also be electrically tested in situ – so-called dynamic testing – which can reveal problems in the wider power-machine-load system.\nUS-based utility company Pacific Gas & Electric was facing a potential $23,000 bill to replace a motor on a 125hp screen refuse pump, which was overheating and drawing excessive current. Rather than simply replacing the motor, the company looked into the reason for the high current – as there were no signs of bearing problems, current imbalance, excessive harmonics or rotor bar problems.\nAn SKF Baker Exp3000 revealed that the load was running higher than the rated value. Looking back through the maintenance history, the company found that a 15.75in impeller on the pump had been replaced with a 17in impeller. Once the correct-sized impeller was installed, the current returned to normal values.\nThe testing helped to prevent a costly mistake – as a new motor would also have been overloaded by the oversized impeller.\nAlso in the energy industry, on-line testing helped prevent a huge loss at a Progress Energy power plant in the US. Technicians were investigating why one of three submerged circulating water pumps was requesting less input power and – as a result – running faster. Using an SKF Exp3000 it captured the torque signature of all three motors, giving a snapshot of the load demands of each one. The pump under investigation had a torque of about 75% that of a healthy pump. The torque band was also too wide, and varied dramatically. The underwater pump was examined by a diver – who discovered that the end bell had fallen off, causing the problem.\nThe pump was quickly repaired – which helped to maintain output when one of the other pumps failed soon afterwards. The company estimates that it would have lost $3.5m in revenue if output levels had fallen. In each of these cases – and many others – a cheap, simple testing regime has saved huge amounts of money, while ignoring test results can cost a company dearly.\nIn a recent survey, plant managers were asked what types of condition monitoring they carried out. Vibration and thermal analysis were both commonly used, but insulation testing was not. While it may not be as prevalent, it is just as necessary – especially as insulation weakness causes nearly as many problems as bearing failure.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

Enjoy! 😀 The restaurant is at downtown Disney and if you ask for the recipe they have it on little recipe cards.\nIn a large pot, sweat the onions, carrots and squash in the butter. Saute well, but do not brown!\nAdd the vegetable stock and potatoes. Cook all the vegetables until they are tender. Add the cream and curry powder. Simmer for approximately 5 minutes. With a hand blender, puree until smooth. Strain through a fine strainer. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nAdjust the sweetness and acidity with sugar and lemon juice. NOTE: The sugar and lemon juice are used as adjustments to the flavor. The quantities are approximations due to the change in sweetness of the squash throughout the year.\nHow much does this make? It sounds like large amounts of ingredients.\nThank you for sharing this recipe with us. However, I don’t work harder than I must. I wouldn’t bother to strain it. if necesary I might mash it with a potato masher. Also when I make soup I include the squash, pumpkin, etc seeds. Nutritionists alwasys say that berries, flax seeds, etc are so good for you. I presume it is because there is life in the seeds and they empower me.\nThis sounds wonderful! Thank you for sharing! My fall squash are slowly beginning to ripen and this sounds like a wonderful way to use my garden produce. Roz, you are correct, this is going to make a very large pot of soup. However, I bet it either freezes well or you could simply halve the recipe.\nIs this the recipe from the WP Express at Downtown Disney? Had the soup there this summer and really liked it.\nI don’t know if it is or not.\nyes astrid .. it is .. and when asked they give you the recipe card so you can make at home ..\nas far as how much will it make .. well .. i kinda cheated on mine .. yes i know i am bad .. but i dont have time to roast the squash in the oven and then etc .. so what i did was go to the supermarket and get a pkg of the already puree’s squash (frozen) and added 1 more pkg of puree’d turnip (actually its pretty good) .. and 1 box of chicken broth and salt and pepper .. when it was slightly warm, blended in a blender (a portion at a time, i dont have a huge blender) .. and while cooking, i added a few sprinkles of instant potatoes to thicken up ..\nit wasnt exactly the same taste and well, we thought it was really good ..\nof course, hubby never tasted the soup from downtown disney (the WP express restaurant) .. but he enjoyed it ..\nit was small enuff for us .. and we even had enuff for leftovers for the next day ..\ni served with grilled cheese/tomatoe sandwiches and a small salad ..\nalso, to the soup, i did cut up a very small onion (finely diced) and i did add a pinch of the cream very small tho .. bc the portions were much smaller .. i cant remember if i added heavy whipping cream or half and half .. but i know it was still good to eat .. and i didnt have any lemons or lemon juice on hand so that wasnt added either ..\ni love their soup but i made my own version with what i had to work with and yes, it was very enjoyable .. and the fact that i could get already puree’d butternut squash in the freezer section of the supermarket made it alot easier too .. as far as the turnips were concerned, i never tasted turnips but there was a lady next to me that made her own homemade baby food and her baby loved it .. she said she tasted it and said it had a sweet taste like carrots do (they are sweet) .. so that is why i used it . if u go on you tube .. some recipes call for pumpkin puree or carrots ..\nmy co worker makes hers like the paula deen recipe on the food network ..\ni also added a bit of water to the box of broth (after i had emptied out the broth) .. to make it a bit watery .. bc i knew i was going to add a sprinkle of the instant potatoes .. bc the card said to add potatoes ..\ni played with the recipe a bit .. and yes, again, it came out well .. 😀 ..\nthe cream, again, i used very sparingly .. didnt want it to taste “milky” like ..\nagain, it was similar in taste of what i did and well .. i love that soup too .. in fact, my kids are going there tonite and i told them to bring me and hteir father home some ..\nbut it is an enjoyable soup and well, i have never froze it myself but i imagine it would freeze well ..\ni did ask how is the soup made (already made and in a big bag that they open and just heat on the stove) or do they make it fresh every day .. the waiter told me they open a bag that comes already made and they heat it up .. next time i am there i will ask a manager if i can buy a box/bag of the soup .. it is worth it and freeze it in portions ..\nsame thing with denny’s and their soups .. the soup comes in bags and they add water.. i did ask and yes .. as soon as i get a freezer (hoping santa will get me one for xmas) .. then i will be getting the soups that hubby likes .. for $10-$15 for those bags and then portion them out .. its cheaper this way .. i dont like them but he does .. adn well with his disabillities .. it makes him happy .. and less time consuming for me and esp if i have to get a “Dad” sitter .. and i am gone a few days ..\nhere is another butternut squash soup.\nPeel the squash and cut into large cubes. Halve the potatoes cut the onion into thick slices.\nIn a medium saucepan, warm the butter over med. heat.

In a continued effort to get President Donald Trump and falsely tie him with the Russians, CNN was forced to delete, retract and scrub their fake news story involving an investigation of a Russian investment fund with potential ties to several associates of President Donald Trump. This is what happens when a news outlet operates as a arm of the Democrat party and reports propaganda, not news. Whether this be considered fake news or wrong news, the fact of the matter is that CNN went with it because they hoped it was true news and another attempt to smear the Trump presidency.\nBut by Friday night, the story was removed from CNN’s website and all links were scrubbed from the network’s social media accounts.\nNeither Frank or CNN immediately responded to requests for comment, and a spokesperson for the Senate Intelligence Committee wasn’t available to comment.\nIn addition to retracting its story, CNN also apologized to Anthony Scaramucci, an adviser to Trump during the presidential campaign and a member of his transition team’s executive committee, who was mentioned in the story as having met Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) that the network said is overseen by Vnesheconombank, a state-run bank that is currently under U.S. sanctions.\nCheck out the VIDEO below where in 1992 Sen. Joe Biden says that a president should not nominate a SCOTUS once the political season is underway. Hmm, just how hypocritical is this White House? Barack Obama has previously filibustered previous SCOTUS nominees, but now talks a different game when the shoe is on the other foot. So did Senate Democrats. So does his VP. Biden literally stated that he not only did not want the Supreme Court Justice vacancy filled, but he also did not want the Judiciary Committee to even hold hearings on a nomination. Well how do you like that? Biden wanted President Bush to decline from making a nomination altogether. Boy aren’t the two hypocrites in the White House singing a different tune these days.\nBut when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in June 1992, Biden suggested Democrats should “seriously consider” not holding confirmation hearings for a Supreme Court nominee put forward by President George H.W. Bush if a justice were to retire in the final months of the presidential election year.\n“The Senate Judiciary Committee should seriously consider not scheduling hearings on the nomination, until after the political campaign season is over,” Biden said in a floor address on June 25, 1992, about reforming the Supreme Court confirmation process.\nWe all knew that one day Joe Biden would put his foot in his mouth with all of his crazy comments. Who knew that it would be one regarding the appointment of SCOTUS nominees and would knee cap Barack Obama. As Hot Air opines, thanks Joe!\nHow do you spin this if you’re the White House? I guess by focusing on the calendar. Biden said this in late June, several weeks after Bill Clinton had effectively clinched the Democratic nomination. The claim here will be that when Biden said “once the political season is underway,” he meant the general election, not the primary. But there’s no reason to draw that kind of line. The possibility that the next president will fill Scalia’s vacancy is already affecting votes in the process of choosing that president. All we can do now is let the process play out. Thanks, Joe!\nNY Times: Joe Biden Argued for Delaying Supreme Court Picks in 1992.\nBut in a speech on the Senate floor in June 1992, Mr. Biden, then the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said there should be a different standard for a Supreme Court vacancy “that would occur in the full throes of an election year.” The president should follow the example of “a majority of his predecessors” and delay naming a replacement, Mr. Biden said. If he goes forward before then, the Senate should wait to consider the nomination.\n“Some will criticize such a decision and say that it was nothing more than an attempt to save a seat on the court in hopes that a Democrat will be permitted to fill it, but that would not be our intention,” Mr. Biden said at the time. “It would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the political season is underway, and it is, action on a Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over.\nMr. Biden’s speech came to light on Monday as the White House said Mr. Obama was poring through a thick binder of potential nominees, with an eye toward deciding on his pick within weeks. It quickly became fodder for Republicans who have suggested that the president should wait to name a successor to Justice Scalia, or that the Senate should delay considering one.\nWe all knew, well I hope most us us knew, that Donald Trump was not a true Conservative, he just latched on the the discontent and the frustration with all politicians, especially those in Washington, DC and especially with many in the Republican party who were tired of being lied to. Make no mistake about it, the Republican party has betrayed its base, but not by Conservatives, but instead by the GOP establishment and those in leadership roles. Those like Ted Cruz draw the ire of the Republican sellouts and go along to get along GOP politicians. Much like Ronald Reagan did in the 1980′s.\nSo a note to Donald Trump, either you haven’t a clue to what you are talking about or you are a wolf in Democrats clothing. As it is hardly the Conservatives who have sold out the base. Because we all know that it was conservatives who have political campaign donations to Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. Oh, oops, that was Donald Trump. We don’t need lectures from who sold out the Conservative cause when he was actively making donations to the other side.\nThere is a reason why CNN is called the Clinton News Network and the MSM is called the Democrat-Media complex. One has to look no farther than the recent CNN Town Hall in Iowa where you can plainly see and hear for yourself that Hillary Clinton was asked a planted question. One of Hillary Clinton’s final questions was from a young student named Brett Rosengren where he said prior to actually asking the question, “I can see why they gave you this.” THEY! WHO IS THEY?\nObviously, this was a planted question. Sorry LIBS, as much as you want to try and defend the obvious, you were busted!!! So it makes you wonder how many of the other questions were the same and did the candidates know them in advance to prepare their answers.

That’s sort of shocking, isn’t it?\nI write in The Survivors Club about the “myth of hopelessness.” People think that all plane crashes are fatal. That’s because of TWA 800 and Egypt Air and ValuJet and Pan Am 103 and all these other flight names and numbers that are emblazoned in our mind because everybody died. But in fact, if you look at the last two major incidents involving passenger jets in the United States, in Denver and now this one — I’m assuming from the CNN reporting that they think everyone is safe — but in both of the major incidents, the plane that went off the runway in Denver and this incident, you’ve got very, very high survival rates: 100% in Denver — with some injuries, obviously — and what looks like 100% here. People generally believe that no one survives a plane crash. But according to government data, 95.7% of the passengers involved in airplane crashes categorized as accidents actually survive. Then, if you look at the most serious plane crashes, that’s a smaller number; the survival rate in the most serious kinds of accidents is 76.6%. So the point there is, when the NTSB [National Transportation Safety Board] analyzed all the airplane accidents between 1983 and 2000, 53,000 people were involved in those accidents, and 51,000 survived. That’s an incredibly high survival rate.\nAre you surprised that all the passengers seem to have gotten off the plane so quickly?\nYou write in your book about attending an FAA workshop on surviving plane crashes. What were some of the most important tips that you can recall from that session?\nI also pay careful attention to the safety card and the safety briefing, because every plane is different. That information is part of developing a plan, and because I know that plane crashes are survivable, I want to know what the exits are, what the equipment is. I want to know what’s under my seat. I actually reach under the seat with my hands and touch to make sure that my life jacket is actually there. So the safety briefings are very important. The FAA has done research on safety briefings, and they find that the least informed people, those that don’t pay attention to the safety briefings, are frequent fliers.

The insurgents have killed hundreds since they launched an uprising in 2009.\nThey mostly target security forces or authority figures but in the past year have turned their sites on Christian worshippers, attacking churches in an apparent attempt to stoke a wider sectarian conflict.\nIn November, 65 people were killed in attacks claimed by Boko Haram on churches, mosques and police stations in Damaturu, where security forces often clash with Islamists in gun battles.\nBoko Haram claimed responsibility for church attacks on the first two Sundays of this month but has yet to do so for the most recent.\nMuslims and Christians that make up most of Nigeria’s 160-million population mostly live side by side in peace, but there have been occasional bouts of sectarian violence since independence from Britain in 1960.\nThe white jet grew closer, buzzing the top of a building and chopping a coconut tree as it descended, before finally smashing into a compound and causing the neighbourhood to erupt with a violent shake.\n“We saw the plane just coming toward us like this,” said Emeka Okafor, a 41-year-old father of two who lived on the middle floor of a two-storey residential building badly damaged in the crash.\nThe crash on Sunday afternoon of a Dana Air MD83 passenger plane on the northern outskirts of Nigeria’s largest city of Lagos killed at least 159 people, making it one of the worst air disasters in a country that has had more than its share.\nNigeria has grounded domestic airline Dana while an investigation continues, with questions swirling over what caused the crash of the 22-year-old plane.\nThe country’s civil aviation chief has said the flight reported both of its engines having failed before crashing.\nResidents of the neighbourhood where it plunged described a surreal set of events in the city of around 15 million, with some saying they had no idea what had hit, but knew they had to run, seeing flames, smoke and destruction as they did.\nThe plane with 153 people on board ploughed into a church, a house, a textbook warehouse and a two-storey apartment block that was home to 40 people, including Okafor, who made it out with his family.\nSix people from the now demolished apartment block – four residents and two visitors – have so far been confirmed dead.\nSome in the neighbourhood speculated that the pilot may have been aiming for a small, overgrown lot just beyond the chopped coconut tree and across from where he crashed. They wondered if he hoped crash-landing there would save lives.\nThe crash happened as Nigeria’s national football team was set to play a World Cup qualifying match against Namibia in the southeastern city of Calabar, and many residents were readying to watch it on television.\nChinyere Peace Eweh, a 37-year-old mother of three, lived on the top floor of the building, but was at Bible study with her children and husband at the time of the crash. A friend called her to say that her flat was on fire.\n“This is the only thing I have – and my Bible,” she said, pointing to her clothes.\nAs residents were still trying to piece together what happened, chaos broke out at the crash site as thousands rushed into the area.\nSome helped by directing fire hoses into the site, with masses of arms holding the lines above their heads, but others simply added to the confusion, while some even looted.\nAuthorities responded with whips to clear the crowd and rocks flew through the air. A helicopter tried to land and provoked pandemonium, while rescue workers faced difficulties accessing the scene.\nBy Tuesday, at least 150 bodies had been recovered, including a woman clutching her daughter.\nMany of the human remains were unrecognisable, and rescue officials say DNA testing will be used with the help of international partners.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

{"best_of": 1, "echo": true, "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 0, "model": "opt-1.5b", "n": 1, "prompt": "I get asked all the time about the pricing structure of cabinets; why, in particular, can one company charge $3,000 for cabinets while another one charges $30,000 for what looks like the same number and types of cabinets. This section is my attempt to answer that question (keep in mind I am only familiar with the New Jersey market and everything I say refers to NJ, but should apply to anywhere in the US and if you do not understand any of the terms used in this section, feel free to click on the Zeek's University link, where most all of the terms are explained, many with pictures.). The price you pay for kitchen cabinets is determined by three main components: The manufacturer, the cabinet construction and the dealer.\nThe manufacturer is the company that makes the cabinet and is probably the largest component in the price of kitchen cabinets. Like all companies they set their price based on many factors, but in general, the more options a manufacturer offers the more their cabinets will cost. By options, I mean, how many door styles, types of wood, colors, types of cabinets they offer as well as the types of modifications they allow and if they allow custom colors or cabinets--I do not mean how the cabinet is built. What this means is that a manufacturer that is set up to make custom cabinets will charge more money for their cabinets than a manufacturer that sells only stock cabinets, even if you buy cabinets that look and are built exactly like the ones from the stock company. Thus the best way for you to save money on your kitchen cabinets is to create a layout that uses only stock size cabinets and then pick a standard door style, type of wood and color. By doing this, you will be able to buy your cabinets from a cheaper manufacturer (NOTE: this is not the same as buying a cheaper made cabinet--that is the subject of the next section).\nHow much of a difference, you ask, a lot. A semi-custom manufacturer can easily be twice the cost of a stock manufacturer and a custom manufacturer 4 times more. However, most customers that go with the stock cabinets, also go with the cheaper door styles, colors and upgrade options whereas those going with the higher end manufacturers go with more expensive door styles, colors and cabinet styles thus the differences appear even more dramatic. For me, most of my customers using my best value manufacturers spend $2,000 to $5,000 on their cabinets, my mid range spend $8,000 to $12,000 and my high end spend $10,000 to $20,000.\nThe cabinet construction is how the cabinet itself is built and is probably the second largest factor in the price you pay. For example, the cabinet can be made of particle board or plywood, the drawers can be dovetail or box with regular guides or full extension guides, the doors can be a standard shaker style or a fancy beaded style, the wood can be a simple maple or more exotic mahogany, the drawer fronts can be flat or decorative, etc. How the cabinets are built is a separate issue from who builds the cabinets. Just because a manufacturer is cheaper does not mean the cabinets are built cheaper. Your layout, door style and color are what limits you to only certain manufacturers, but within each manufacturer there are still many different construction options. Thus if you decide that you want a fancy beaded door style, then you will be limited to buying your cabinets from a manufacturer that makes that particular door style that you like (and it probably will be a mid level or higher manufacturer). Again, the manufacturer alone does not determine how the cabinet is built, only what options you have to choose from. It's like a car, an expensive model might come standard with power windows and cruise control, but a cheaper model offers them as an optional upgrade (does this means it is an inferior power window?), however, if you are looking for a particular color that is not offered on the cheaper model then you will have no choice but to go with the more expensive model.\nHow much of a difference, up to twice the cost. Let's break it down into the following 6 options (although there are plenty more): (1) dovetail drawers and full extension guides add about $100 per drawer, (2) decorative drawer fronts (also know as 5 piece) are drawer fronts that look like the door, rather than flat, and can add $50 to $100 per drawer, (3) paint colors are typically 10 to 15% more than stain colors & glazes are an additional 10 to 15% more, (4) all plywood construction adds about 15% over particle board, (5) cherry wood is 5 to 15% more than maple which is 5 to 10% more than oak, and (6) a fancy beaded door style can be 30% more than a simple recessed one. Add them all up and a kitchen with the exact same layout from the same manufacturer with upgraded drawers, painted/glazed doors (+30%), plywood construction (+15%) and cherry wood (+15%) with a fancy door style (+30%) can easily be twice the cost of one with regular drawers, stain color, particle board and a standard oak door style. Remember this is the same layout from the same manufacturer, only the construction is different. For me, I don't sell all particle board cabinets, maple or cherry make up 95% of my wood types and most all my customers upgrade the drawers to dovetail with full extension. Thus construction options generally add about 20 to 50% for most of my customers.\nThe dealer is the store that you buy the cabinets from and surprisingly plays the smallest role in the final price you pay for the cabinets. This may seem crazy since if you go to 2 different dealers you will get 2 completely different prices that can vary by thousands of dollars, however, this is because those 2 dealers priced out your kitchen using different manufacturers and probably different layouts and cabinet construction. If you were to decide on a specific manufacturer, layout, door style and cabinet construction, then went to 2 different dealers that represent that manufacturer the price for the cabinets would probably not vary by more than 20%. This is because the profit margin on kitchen cabinets for dealers is generally in the 25 to 50% range (the less expensive the cabinets, the higher the margin tends to be, the margin difference for 2 dealers using the same manufacturer would be even smaller). Thus when you see an ad from a dealer that claims their cabinets are 40% less then their competitors, they are clearly not comparing cabinets from the same manufacturer and/or same design/layout. Three factors make up the dealer's cost structure and thus how much you will pay for their cabinets: rent, advertising and work force.\nA store located in an area where rent is cheaper has lower expenses and thus does not have to mark up their product as much to cover the rent. A big box player, like home depot, probably pays around $20,000 in rent for the space they dedicate to their kitchen showroom, in contrast to a small dealer that pays more like $2,000 to $5,000 a month. Of course rent is small compared to advertising, which can run into the thousands a month. Advertising is very expensive in NJ. A color ad in a typical mailer (like ValPak) runs $500 to $1,000. A store that has full page color ads in several mailers (or several TV or radio ads) can easily spend $5,000 to $10,000 a month. Last is the employee expense, which can be very large or nothing. Employees in NJ are even more expensive then advertising. A brand new kitchen designer (someone right out of college with no experience) can cost $3,000 per month, an experienced one can cost $5,000 to $6,000 per month. Doing kitchen designs are not easy, they involve a high level of computer skills, plus the designer needs to have a very good feel for numbers and the pay is based on a salary plus commission--so the designer is a salesman (and all the negative images that pop up with that title--which explains why designers are always trying to upsell you). Most of the people that enter this field leave it quickly; many don't even like doing it. Simply go to any home depot or lowes, get friendly with some of the kitchen designers and ask them what they want to be doing 5 years from now and most all will say anything other than kitchen design. It's an unfortunate reality of this business, it's hard and expensive to find good help. In fact, because of the cost of employees, many kitchen companies can no longer even sell cheaper cabinets. To justify the time necessary to create a kitchen layout, most companies need the price to be at least $6,000 and many now charge for design services and/or to get copies of the layouts (even at lowes it's hard to get a designer to do a layout for you with their cheapest line any more). So to summarize, a store located in an area where rent is cheaper, does not advertise heavily and is run by the owner (with no employees) will have fewer expenses and be able to sell their cabinets by as much as 20% less and make the same profit. Which, of course is me, my store is in a low rent area, I do not advertise & I run the business myself with no employees. In fact, half the kitchens I sell are under $6,000 and 25% under $3,000 and I still charge nothing for layout services and freely give out copies of all designs I make.\nOf course on the other side of the cost equation is revenues. Obviously businesses would not advertise if it did not bring in more business, and more revenues means more customers to share your expenses with, and thus lower prices. However, this business is not like other businesses. The customer's decision on who to buy a kitchen from is not based solely on cost. In fact, I would estimate that the single biggest factor the customer uses in determining who to buy cabinets from is his/her gut feeling as to whether or not he/she is going to get screwed (I know it sounds crude but it is nevertheless true). This industry has a lot of scam artists and just plain poor businesspeople running kitchen stores. In fact, big box players like home depot and lowes only survive because people inherently trust them. Tons of independent stores (like me) can easily beat them on price and blow them away on service, but how do you find the gems among the fakes. Customers know that if a big chain store screws them they can go write letters to the corporate execs or file a complaint with the better business bureau or even sue them and they will be around. If an independent takes your money and disappears you have no recourse and even if you find him and sue him he may not have any money to pay you anyway. In this industry it's not revenues that count but the hit ratio--that's the ratio of the number of customers that actually buy compared to the number that go through the process of creating a layout and design and then don't buy. Designers typically place their customers into 2 classifications: those that were referred and those that weren't. Customers that come based on a referral from a prior customer or contractor the store works with are the golden customers, by being referred from someone they trust, the customer automatically trusts the store (at least to some extent) and is much more likely to buy. Their hit ratio is typically 1 in 3. Whereas a customer that comes in because of an ad in a flyer is not nearly as likely to buy, with a hit ratio of 1 in 8 to 1 in 10. This is why designers always ask how you heard about their store. There are lots of in between classifications too, like customers that came because they saw your store there for so many years, but were not referred (they feel some trust because the store has been there a long time) and customers that find you on referral websites or from the better business bureau, that implies some integrity. Since a designer will spend about 5 to 10 hours with a customer before they buy and 1 to 5 hours for one that doesn't, a store is spending a lot of time and thus money helping people that will never buy from it. Because of all the time a designer spends helping people that never buy, in a typical store a single designer can only handle around $50,000 to $100,000 per month in sales. Thus if a store advertises heavily it will then have to higher more people to handle the extra traffic, and since the people coming in will be non referred customers they will have a lower hit ratio then the regular traffic and cost the store more money to convert into customers. And on top of that you will then have the designers fighting over who gets the referred customers, who are more likely to buy and thus make the designers more money since they are paid on commission. So as you can see increased revenues does not mean the store can spread its costs around more customers and thus sell their products cheaper. Rent is about the only cost that stays constant as sales increase.

The good news is that setting up your own court is easy, quick and relatively inexpensive.\nCourts can be set up on almost any type of indoor or outdoor hard surface. Typical places would include existing tennis, basketball or volleyball courts either at private homes or perhaps you can convince your local HOA to allow them at existing recreational areas.\nThe first thing you will need is a portable net. The cost of nets range from a low of $70 to a high of about $150. Nets come in a canvas bag and are very portable. With some practice a portable net can be set up in less than 10 minutes and once you get good at it in about 5 minutes. You can purchase portable nets at many sporting goods stores and of course on-line.\nNext comes the tape. Orange painter’s tape is the standard because of its high visibility and low cost. You can buy painter’s tape at very affordable prices at most home improvement or hardware stores. Your fellow players never mind chipping in towards the cost of needed supplies.\nThe next step is to take measurements and mark off all of the corners of the various boxes. Once this is complete you just lay down the straight line of tape from corner to corner. (See the diagram below for of the precise measurements).\nIf you set up your own court, please send us a picture as we would enjoying seeing all of the creative environments where people play and remember - the first Pickleball court ever was improvised in 1965 in a backyard on Bainbridge Island!", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

Along with seeing acquaintances ask this question, I also receive multiple inquiries a day asking my pricing for a particular session and they are flabbergasted by the amount I charge.\nLet me start off by saying this, my pricing is average for our area. I try my best to be reasonable and considerate, but still cover my business expenses. Believe me, I understand how expensive it is to provide for a family and want nice things too.\nSo, why does that photographer charge so much? Let me tell you!\nIf you think photographers just push a button and throw a filter on your images, you are so wrong!\nDuring your session, your photographer spends time adjusting settings on their camera to produce the perfect image. The have to adjust their ISO, F Stop, Shutter Speed, and white balance. Your photographer may even have to do this multiple times, because the light changes, kids become more active , etc. Not only do they have to adjust settings, they pay attention to details and use their knowledge of posing to be able to provide you with a beautiful picture.\nA photographer spends hundreds if not thousands of dollars on their education to understand how their gear works, whether that be college or workshops. Let me add this, photographers never stop learning. We are always trying to improve and learn new technique to help us stand out and provide you with the best quality possible.\nThe next thing that factors into the amount photographers charge is travel expenses, gear, props, maintenance on our gear, insurance, editing programs, image delivery, website fees, internet, electricity, taxes, and yes, our TIME!\nI, personally, spend anywhere from 20-30 minutes per image that I edit! I focus on skin tones, shadows, contrast, temperature, and so much more. Being a mom of 4 kiddos, that is a lot of time that I am away from them.\nAside from the time spent on creating beautiful images for you and your family, a lot of photographers pay out monthly to keep their business running. Websites, delivery sites, editing programs, internet, sometimes rent and props, electricity, fuel, and business fees (taxes & insurance) are not free!!\nI could probably go on and on, but to keep this short and sweet I will stop here. As a mom that just wants pictures of my family, I can totally understand why you might think photographers charge too much, but I hope that after reading this you can now understand how much it takes to run our business.\nThank you for taking time to read!\nPrevious What Do We Wear?!?\nNext Black Friday & Cyber Monday Sales Extended!\nBe sure to visit us on Facebook and give us a like!", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

However it does much, much more than that. It details the trials, tribulations traumas and triumphs of a father and son working together towards a common goal. What is all the more remarkable is the fact that they undertake the restoration of a much loved British car in a remote location in the Australian Bush.\nRichard and Bill McKellar are not professional restorers. However they are most definitely enthusiastic and dedicated Morris Minor devotees. Bill is a retired Bank manager and Richard is Creative Director in his own Graphic Design and Advertising Company based in Melbourne. Nevertheless, through sheer hard work and dedication they have overseen the transformation of what Richard engagingly describes as a ‘bitser’ car, to one that would grace any Concours D’Elegance competition.\nTheir enthusiasm shines through the text which is written with feeling and contains lots of practical advice gained from first hand experience. Technical manual it is not. However it is an invaluable guide to the practical aspects of completing the many detailed and often complicated tasks which the home based restorer inevitably has to grapple with. One of the main strengths of the book is the quality of the photographic material. A picture is worth a thousand words is an oft quoted saying and within this book it certainly rings true. What is also significant is that although the vehicle in question is a limited edition model, it is in essence a standard 2 door Morris Minor Saloon. As Richard points out the principles involved are equally applicable to any Morris Minor, though the detail specifications may vary slightly from model to model.\nThough modest about their achievements, it is fair to say that the range of the advice, guidance and information provided here is impressive. Richard and Bill would be thrilled to bits if, through their efforts in completing the restoration and charting their progress, they encouraged other like minded enthusiasts to complete the restoration of their Morris Minor wherever they are in the world.\nWith this publication at their side they will be better placed to do so.\nAdditional contributions to the book by Ray Newell, an acknowledged authority on the Morris Minor, provide an insight into the historical aspect of the Morris Minor Million story and some factual information about some of the other Minor Million survivors. Given the high standard of the restoration undertaken, Ray reviews the Concours scene, and along with Richard adds useful guidance to would be and current competitors including an insight into the rules and regulations governing this prestigious aspect of Classic Car ownership.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

Why, tour a select number of knitting shops in the great state of Oregon, of course! In case you ever have a chance to visit our lovely state, and need a list of some fibery stops along the way -- this post is for you!\nFirst, we made a surprise stop in Astoria to Salon Boheme, where my wonderful husband had arranged for a haircut and manicure for me :) Here's the before and after for my new hairdo! I have nothing but good things to say about this particular salon -- if you ever get a chance to stop in and pamper yourself, I highly recommend it!\nWe then started our knitting journey along the Oregon coast, in the town of Seaside -- home of Creative Beginnings. This store specializes in yarn, as well as beads, and scrapbook supplies. They do have several aisles of yarns, along with many samples and garments to admire. Because they carry such a diverse assortment of crafting supplies, the salesperson may or may not be able to answer any yarn questions you might have.\nSeveral knitted items are also for sale in this store, along with pricing ideas in case you would rather knit your own. There is a cat that roams freely throughout the store, as well as a small indoor espresso stand. The aisles are large and easy to navigate, and there is plenty of inspiration if you are in the market for a new project!\nNext up is Coastal Yarns in the town of Cannon Beach. This little store is tucked away amidst the tourist shops lining the street. They do carry some local fiber, including Blue Moon Fiber arts, and they have a lovely selection of books and patterns with a cozy seating area. I have visited this store many times, and each time I have been pleasantly greeted by a very helpful clerk. This particular time, I chose a skein of Noro Silk Garden that exactly matched a luxurious project bag that I am sending to a friend of mine. In the back, there is a wall of luxury sock yarns that I love to browse through, as well as a fun selection of knitting notions and buttons.\nFinally, 10 miles down the coast from Cannon Beach is the town of Manzanita -- home to T-SPOT Yarn & Chocolates. I adore this store... from the darling way she has her yarns displayed against the back wall, to the wonderful selection of knitting samples and garments she has displayed throughout the store. This shop also carries gifts, embroidery designs, and gourmet chocolate (we decided to try the \"Bacon\" variety!)

As a result of which, it can cause serious environmental issues like pollution, health issues of the people living nearby and also turning vacant lands into landfills causing a reduction of available lands for living. It is also estimated that in Russia and Africa, only 10 to 20% of these wastes are recycled whereas in countries like Japan, Germany and France about 60 to 100% of industrial wastes is recycled or used in construction. So, Russia is definitely lagging behind.\nMost of the waste recycling and incineration plants fail to recycle these waste products ecologically and only add up to the problem. Moreover, due to high cost of waste disposal, need of raw materials etc. most companies often prefer to the use of “symbolic fines” rather than dealing with the problem itself. The process of recycling waste is also quite expensive and not a profitable venture.\nAngenium is a unique project that will completely decompose man-made waste products into constituents of high cost. It’s technology uses a unique sorbent that will work on all types of waste products and will extract precious metals like gold, silicon dioxide, aluminium dioxide, iron oxide and also pyrite cinders. The sorbent is 10 times cheaper than other analogues in the market. Even secondary resources like plastic, metal, radio electronic components are crushed and extracted to its full value. For e.g. from 1 ton of old mobile phones one can get 150 g of gold which is remarkable. The Blockchain based ecosystem will use tokens for all its transactions. Buyers will be provided with a certificate for purchase of products in the system and it will be recorded in the Blockchain network. The token used in the system is Angenium coin or ANG_Coin, which is ERC20 compliant and is based on the Ethereum Blockchain.\nA universal sorbent material that works on all metals and ensures 99.9% purity.\nIt can be operated anywhere from any country and has a capacity of 5000 to 1000000 tons of waste recycling per year.\nThe franchise is available everywhere on a “ready-to-operate” basis.\nIt is in compliance with all the legal procedures and legislations and maintains all the standard ecological standards.\nIt is trademark protected and requires no approval for fourth or fifth grade non-toxic waste recycling, as the sorbent is organic.\nIt is ecologically balanced and does not affect the environment.\nIt will release tons of lands which were earlier filled with wastes.\nLow operational costs with wide range of final products from iron, gold to even rare earth metals.\nHigh market price for final products and the system will likely be adopted by many countries.\nIn Russia alone about 1.5 billion tons of ash and slag has covered about 28,000 hectares of land and about 50 million tons of pyrite wastes are generated from the Russian power plants. This is a major setback for the environment and economic landscape of the county resulting in health issues and reduction of available land for living.\nThe main aim of Angenium is to recycle these wastes at a very low cost, but produce final products of high cost that can also contribute to the economic growth of the nation. It will increase the volume and speed of mining process of precious metals where waste products will be the raw materials.

Born in the year 1983, Christopher Cartwright has a background in the field of medicine where he served as a paramedic. Cartwright also served as a Scuba Diver and sailor. Upon completing his high school education, Christopher Cartwright majored in paramedics, emergency management, and nursing. Currently, Christopher Cartwright resides in Sydney with his spouse and two lovely children.\nThe Last Airship is the first installment in the Sam Reilly book series. This narrative has not only been well written but also brilliantly narrated as well. The Last Airship is a first moving narrative about power and wealth, blackmail, and greed, friendship and betrayal. The book begins during the early days of World War II, Magdalene, an exceptional art luxury airship, takes off quickly from Munich. On board, the state of the art ship were two exceedingly wealthy families, and a friend of the owner, who happens to be an academic professor. However, the state of the art airship was never seen again. Several years later, the airship was never found again. 75 years down the line, two climbers find a letter stamped with the family’s official crest in the Alps. One of the climbers is one, Sam Riley, whom eventually finds himself in a life-threatening situation.\nThere were sections of the Last Airship that were dramatically atmospheric. Author Christopher Cartwright has not only written well but also clearly in suitable pace. The readers are definitely going to be fully invested in Christopher Cartwright’s narrative from the first page to the very last. Cartwright can take the readers on a roller coaster ride.\nThe year is 1638, and one Albert Olsen, a worker of the Dutch Trading post, discovers the body of Orichalcum, as he was shoveling the sludge in the banks of one of the local rivers. Olsen immediately informs Hank Worthington, the lead engineer. Being an inquisitive person, Olsen decides to dive and beneath the bank, he discovers that there was a hidden city. However, Olsen boss does not take the revelation kindly and in the process brutally murders Olsen to ensure that the hidden city that he had discovered remains hidden forever. Author Christopher Cartwright then takes the readers to the present date, where we meet with Dr. Swan, who has just returned from Atlantis. Dr. Swan has evidence that doomsday was approaching rapidly. To ensure that she prevents the trigger, Dr. Swan has five weeks only.\nAs Dr. Swan looks for a trigger, she encounters a stalker and immediately asks Sam Reilly to assist her. However, before Sam could meet with Sam Riley, someone abducts her. After a little bit of digging, Sam Rilley discovers that the Phoenix Resistance was responsible for Dr. Swan’s kidnapping. Before Dr. Swan was kidnapped another individual had taken her because she apparently knew how to reach the inner sanctum. However, Dr. Swan eventually realizes that she had not been abducted but rather saved by one, Edward Worthington from the Phoenix Resistance. Just like Dr. Swan, Edward was also conducting his research on the code.\nRogue Wave is undeniably one of the most imaginative narratives in the Sam Riley book series. In Rogue Wave, a team of scientists accidentally creates a monster during an experiment. The team of scientists is offered a cash reward of 20 billion dollars, to look into the recently discovered energy source that can be used to replace man’s reliance on fossil fuel. However, it goes beyond saying, that the research that the team of scientists is handling is much more that the prize of 20 billion dollars. The suspense grows when danger threatens the underwater, from the air and in the water. The Bimini Road, a huge part of the Atlantis ultimately becomes the source, of huge waves, which have the capabilities of destroying the biggest supertankers. The Bimini Road has constantly been Sam’s historical interest mainly because Sam Reilly has clues that the road was used by the ancient people in launching pirate attacks.\nWith that said, Rogue Waves is a fast-paced novel that is filled with numerous scientific points. The plot is quite interesting, and will keep the readers engaged throughout. As the fourth book in the Sam Riley book series, there is plenty of action, and as expected the good guys eventually won.\nThe Nostradamus Equation is a well-written adventure and treasure story that is much similar to the works of Clive Cluster. In Nostradamus Equation, author Christopher Cartwright introduces the readers to Dr. Zack, a descendant of one of the companions of Nostradamus, who is expected to fulfill a prophecy. After discovering the book, Clive decides to escape into the Sahara, with the aim of saving humanity. With that said, Nostradamus Equation is a novel for action and adventure lovers. All the characters in Nostradamus Equation have been brilliantly built. The storyline was not only full of action but also full of the character’s deeds.\nThe Mahogany Ship is an intriguing narrative, that is full of edge of seat thrills and lots of actions. It is a continuation of the Lost Airship. In the Mahogany Ship, we meet once again with Sam Riley and her friends. The group is still looking for the Atlantis as well as a Chinese ship. Just as expected, The Mahogany Ship is filled with chases, danger and escapes since Sam and her team is not the only people who are hunting. In the year 1812, one of the biggest ships in the world, the Emily Rose was shipwrecked. The survivors had no option but to walk more than one thousand miles, to reach Sydney Cove, the only settlement.\nSeveral years later, a monstrous ship is found, a ship that was bigger than any ship that the British Army had ever built. By communicating with the natives, Sam and her group learn that Emily Rose had been there for more than a thousand years. With that said, the Mahogany Ship is a fast paced, page turning action-adventure narrative that is undeniably worth the readers time. The narrative is full of interesting heroes, handsome men, and beautiful women.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

{"best_of": 1, "echo": true, "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 0, "model": "opt-1.5b", "n": 1, "prompt": "This month’s publication takes us back to a topic that started it all for our monthly publications back in January 2004 – variation. That article started out with my spilling milk when I was young. Back in those days, we didn’t have those fancy plastic cups with lids on them. We just had glasses for children that were actually made of glass. No sippy cups. And whose fault was it when my milk spilled? My fault? Certainly not my mother’s fault. Well, understanding variation may change how you look at whose “fault” it is.\nIn addition, this month we introduce how we have made it easier for you to navigate around our 13 years of publications in our SPC Knowledge Base. There are now over 150 articles on a variety of statistical topics – all free for you to access.\nYou may also download a pdf copy of this publication at this link. Please feel free to leave a comment at the end of the publication.\nThis is from our first publication back in January 2004 (with a few edits).\nI used to, now and then, spill a glass of milk when I was young. Our table slanted toward where my mother sat. So, the milk always headed in her direction. And she usually had some choice words when this happened. Of course, I was at fault. I needed to be more careful. Or was that really true? If you understand variation, you will realize that most of the problems you face are not due to individual people, but to the process -- the way it was designed and the way it is managed on a day-to-day basis.\nWhy is it important to know the type of variation present in your process? Because the action you take to improve your process depends on the type of variation present. If special causes are present, you must find the cause of the problem and then eliminate it from ever coming back, if possible. This is usually the responsibility of the person closest to the process.\nIf only common causes are present, you must FUNDAMENTALLY change the process. The key word is fundamentally -- a major change in the process is required to reduce common causes of variation. And management is responsible for changing the process.\nIt has been estimated that 94% of the problems a company faces are due to common causes. Only 6% are due to special causes (that may or may not be people related). So, if you always blame problems on people, you will be wrong at least 94% of the time. It is the process most of the time that needs to be changed. Management must set up the system to allow the processes to be changed.\nSo, Mom, sorry. But most of the time, spilling the milk was not my fault. It was usually yours (management). The glasses were too big for my small hands (no spill-proof cups in those days). When I wanted to put it by the edge of the table to make it easier to reach, you said move it back - I might spill it. And with the meal-time conversation, how could I concentrate on my milk!\nThe first thing to do in process improvement efforts is to teach the concept of variation. You need to know what is due to common causes of variation and what is due to special causes of variation.\nThat first publication back in 2004 also contained the following story. To really understand variation, many people have to change their paradigm. The following is a true story. A plant produced a number of different powdered products. Each of these products was run through the same production equipment at different conditions and put into unique silos (one or more for each product type).\nIt turns out that anyone who had worked in the unit for more than 3 months had time off for cross- contaminating a silo. If everyone is doing it, what type of variation is it? Common cause. And the only way to reduce common cause of variation is to change the process.\nSo how do you separate common from special causes of variation? The only effective way to do this is by using control charts.\nAre these sales numbers the same? The measurements we take reflect the variation in the process. The problem with measurement systems that compare one-time frame to another is that the actual performance (variation) of the process is hidden - we don't know what the underlying process is doing.\nThe monthly sales report is a good example. It compares this month’s sales to last month’s sales. Or maybe to the same month for the previous year. What nonsense. What does this tell you? Well – it tells me if things are better or worse. Does it? Well, I feel better when the sales number is higher. Really? What usually happens after a record sales month? The next month is often lower. You have to understand variation. The assumption that there is one reason why sales are higher this month than last month’s is not valid.\nThe only tool to effectively examine the behavior of a process is a control chart. The data in Table 1 is our sales data. What does this table of data show you?\nThe table does begin to show some of the variation in the underlying process. It is an improvement over the limited comparison of two numbers. But it is still difficult to see the underlying process behavior.\nTo really understand what is happening, you need to construct a control chart. The individuals control chart for the data in Table 1 is shown in the figure below. We will not show the moving range chart here.\nThe upper control limit (UCL) is the largest value you would expect from a process with just common causes of variation present. The lower control limit (LCL) is the smallest value you would expect. As long as the all the points are within the limits and there are no patterns, only common cause of variation are present. The process is said to be \"in control\" To improve it, you must fundamentally change the process.\nAll the points are within the control limits and there are no patterns. The sales process is \"in control.\" Sales might be as low as 3,899 or as high as 14,222 each month. The variation is simply the random variation in the process. We can predict what will happen in the future. As long as the process remains the same, sales will average 9060 per month with the monthly variation being between the control limits.\nQuite often, people will say that the control limits are too wide - and don't really help them. They miss the point. It is not the control limits, but the story that the control chart tells. It provides feedback on the state of the process - improving or declining or in control. And this process is in statistical control, it tells leadership that the process must be fundamentally changed if sales are to increase. The key word here is fundamentally. This means new products, new sales approaches, etc. And the control chart can be used to judge the impact of those fundamental changes.\nSuppose you click on the first article listed. This takes you to the article on variation from January 2004. When you are on the publication page, look at the right-hand column. You will see a list of all the publications in that category. The one you are viewing is listed in black; the others are in blue. This allows you to move to other publications within the category.\nHopefully, this makes it easier to navigate through all the publications to find the ones that interest you!\nWe appreciate you taking time to read our publications. It has been a joy to provide them to you over the years – our gift for those seeking to understand. Best wishes to you and yours in the New Year!\nDoes the interpretation of XmR range chart, like the other variable control (Shewart´s) charts is reliable only if data follow a Normal Distribution? How can we check it?\nIt is not a requirement that data be normally distributed to use a control chart. Points beyond the control limits work pretty well regardless of the type of distribution. The zones tests may give some false signals if the distribution is very skewed, as discussed in the article on Control Chart and Non-Normal Data. As far as determining if data are normally distributed, please see our June 2016 artice: What?

Not only was Reiner a huge fan of the author but felt this novel was the best thing he had written and did everything he could to turn it into a movie. While the screenplay was being kicked around Hollywood by different people, Reiner managed to snag it after he had a one-on-one with the author and received backing from Norman Lear.\nKeeping to the original idea of having the film feel more like a novel, the story begins with the Grandson (Fred Savage) home sick in bed. The Grandfather (Peter Falk) comes to check in on him trying to lift his spirits. To do this, he chooses to read him a story. But what young boy wants to hear a book read to him when he could be playing video games? With some reverse psychology and a little bit of convincing, the Grandfather manages to tell him one of the greatest love stories of all time.\nThe tale begins with the farm boy Westley (Cary Elwes) who falls for the fair maiden Buttercup (Robin Wright). Eventually, he manages to win her over and the two dream of the future together. But a farm boy needs to make a living so he sets off on the high seas to make his fortune. The high seas are a dangerous place for a man and his ship is sunk by the Dread Pirate Roberts.\nFive years pass and the heartbroken maiden, who lost her one true love catches the eye of Prince Humperdink (Chris Sarandon), who convinces her to marry him. Before they can be married, Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of mercenaries. The group is led by the brains, Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) and his two henchmen, Fezzik (Andre The Giant) who is the muscle of the group, and Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), the skilled Spanish swordsman. Vizzini plans to kill the future princess near the border of Florin and Guilder to start a war between the two nations. As the abductors near the Cliffs of Insanity, they find that they are being followed by a lone man all dressed in black. Is he there to rescue her? Is he there to kidnap Buttercup for himself? What exactly are his intentions and most importantly, who is he?\nBy now we should all know the answers to those questions. While the film was not a huge box-office phenomenon during its initial release, it has become a classic and a favorite of millions. Not only does it have swashbuckler action, and the ultimate love story, but it is one of the funniest films of all time.\nThat being said, there’s no reason to critique the movie at this point. What’s left to discuss is how the overall Fathom presentation turned out. In the theatre I attended, there were approximately 80 people there. The crowd was a good selection of age ranges, with a lot of older parents bringing in their adult children. Most of the audience were fans and happy to finally see the film in a theatre. I have to admit that even for myself that was enough to make me happy. But as with other Fathom events, there were some extras. Thirty minutes before the film began, there was the traditional trivia questions posted on the screen, such as Mark Knopfler from Dire Straits wrote the soundtrack; Billy Crystal adlibbed most of his lines; and Courtney Cox, Sean Young, Carrie Fischer, Meg Ryan, and Uma Thurman were all considered for the role of Buttercup. Shortly before the film started and after it ended, there were brief interviews with director Rob Reiner who discussed the filmmaking process, how they went about gathering the cast, and humorous on-set anecdotes.\nI’ve been to several Fathom events and it did not quite live up to the standards I’ve come to expect. The number of trivia questions before the film started were only a handful and the rest of the time was filled with a barrage of commercials, some of them looked like they were having trouble buffering correctly and looked choppy and unfocused. The interview also felt lacking as the only person involved was Reiner even though the interviewer mentioned talking to the rest of the cast about various topics. It would have been nice to have some more interviews or at least some explanation as to why the rest of the cast wasn’t there. Even with these small deficiencies, it was a fun experience to see something I have only watched on television on a big screen and well worth the time and effort.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

I find it hard to fast forward through commercials and I cannot go the food store without walking own all of the aisles because I love seeing the finished product of the work I supported!\nIn 2014, Honey Maid launched the groundbreaking \"This is Wholesome\" campaign, rooted in the idea that while the makeup and day-to-day lives of families have evolved – just like Honey Maid products – the importance of wholesome family connections remains the same. Since launch, we've received accolades internally and externally for boldly showcasing the diversity of American families.\nWe feature five real American families: an adopted son, a disabled veteran, a Hispanic gay couple and neighbors of different cultures. And we tell their stories while inviting viewers to think about acceptance in their own lives. Each video culminates with the creation of a wholesome Honey Maid snack, showing how snacking moments can bring families together. Our integrated marketing campaign includes TV, a dedicated digital and social media program, and media collaborations with the PR team. The creation of this campaign has been a relay race, with lots of baton passing, and with teamwork and trust that took us over the finish line!\nThree years ago, colleagues of mine created the concept for the campaign. When I had the privilege of taking over, my role was to finalize the creative, gather alignment and approvals, and work closely with my Media & Content counterpart to get the videos (the “spots”) up and support via our agency partners.\nWe created this campaign during a time of great change for our Marketing team and our media partners. It required attention to detail, and strong communication to ensure we had continuity and everyone was aligned. There was a lot of learning while doing! As we got ready to launch, our team put an outreach plan in place to consumers and media, mindful of the external environment and how our message would come across. Together we accepted the risk that comes with a fearless marketing campaign like this … and we prepared for many different responses! Fortunately, the public response has been overwhelmingly positive.\n\"This is Wholesome\" makes me proud on so many levels. I'm proud to work for a company and on a brand that spreads messaging of positivity and inclusion. And I'm proud that I was on a team that could rally together in times of change to deliver great work. But what brings me the most pride is hearing the reactions to the campaign from colleagues. We wouldn't have a \"This is Wholesome\" campaign if it were not for the courage and support of so many people. From RD&Q to Sales to our in-store team – we're all working together to create and deliver great products that give us a reason to tell great stories. I know firsthand our advertising instills pride in those who work on Honey Maid and at MDLZ. And I'm so proud to be part of an organization that gives me the opportunity to make campaigns like this a reality.\nHoney Maid recently released the latest chapter in the “This Is Wholesome” campaign, which underscores the importance of acceptance in a changing American culture. The brand is celebrating four different stories of acceptance featuring five families, including a traditional Hispanic father who found joy and love in accepting his gay son and son-in-law, a disabled veteran and wife that have come to accept their new post-war reality, a young boy who has accepted his adopted brother, and two neighboring families who have grown to realize they have more similarities than differences.

Implementing this NAFTA-on-steroids deal would undermine Obama's efforts to battle income inequality. It would be like drilling a hole in a boat just as you are trying to seal the cracks that are letting the water in.\"\nBackground: President Obama's references to trade in tonight's speech were similar to his 2013 SOTU trade mentions: \"To boost American exports, support American jobs and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia, we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific Partnership. And tonight, I'm announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union - because trade that is fair and free across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs.\" Tonight's speech also replayed the administration's standard statement on Fast Track, for instance in the 2013 Annual Trade Policy Agenda: \"To facilitate the conclusion, approval, and implementation of market-opening negotiating efforts, we will also work with Congress on Trade Promotion Authority. Such authority will guide current and future negotiations, and will thus support a jobs-focused trade agenda moving forward.\"\nA letter released Monday by more than 550 Democratic base organizations and a news conference today by Tea Party leaders against Fast Track reiterates the breadth of grassroots opposition. The letter included organizations such as MoveOn, SEIU, AFSCME and the American Federation of Teachers, that have not been involved in past \"trade\" fights and who are strong Obama supporters.\nPast trade pacts' role in fueling the growth of U.S. income inequality is animating new entrants into the Fast Track debate. Over the weekend, former Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich called for opposition to Fast Track and the TPP. The failure of Obama's past SOTU trade promises is feeding skepticism. In his 2011 SOTU, Obama promised the pact would expand U.S. exports to Korea. In the pact's first year, exports dropped 10 percent, imports soared and the U.S. trade deficit with Korea grew 37 percent, equating to a net loss of approximately 40,000 more U.S. jobs.\nDemocratic and GOP presidents have struggled to persuade Congress to provide Fast Track authority, which Congress has authorized for only five years (2002-07) of the past 20. In late 2013, 151 House Democrats signed a letter opposing Fast Track. Two weeks ago, when U.S. Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.) and U.S. Sens. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) introduced legislation to establish Fast Track, 17 Senate Democrats sentletters opposing the bill, which did not have a single House Democratic sponsor. Two groups of GOP representatives have also sent letters opposing Fast Track.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

When it funds a social program it sets in motion a series of destructive consequences. I call it the Law of Progressive Ruin. Welfare serves as the perfect example. People who get a welfare payment come to rely on it. They often become dependent and permanently unemployed. Welfare invariably attracts new recipients and it grows over time. Food stamps serve as an example of this expansion. Most importantly social programs like this cannot be terminated because the politicians, the media and the voters will not allow it. The outcry would intimidate anyone who would dare suggest we eliminate rent subsidies, unemployment, welfare payments or food stamps.\nThese programs carry the seeds of their own destruction because they cannot be stopped and they constantly grow. All government programs and subsidies share these traits. Eventually, they must bankrupt the government that sponsors them. That’s the only way they will be stopped. Then there will be hell to pay with civil unrest and financial chaos.\nThe moment a government makes the first give-away for a new program it sets in motion the Law of Progressive Ruin. Ultimately as time goes on these programs require more and more money until the government can no longer fund them. We are approaching that point in America.\nFurthermore, nobody should ever get money from the government that they didn’t earn. That’s because the government takes it forcibly from people who would not pay it voluntarily. The money necessary to help people must come privately through charity. This is the only moral process for aiding and assisting the indigent. This method will not bankrupt the nation, ruin its economy or expropriate the wealth of the entrepreneurs and productive citizens. It has the added benefit of being more temporary then permanent. This may work hardships on the poor at times but they will be much better for it then what’s happening to them now. The current behavioral breakdown afflicting the underclass is a further example of the Law of Progressive Ruin. The more money passed out by the government the worse the ambition, creativity, ethics and moral turpitude of the recipients.\nThe Law of Progressive Ruin also delivers nasty consequences when excesses of debt and spending prevail. It works with cruel efficiency when high taxes, inflating and big government are the rule. The Law of Progressive Ruin can be seen in a faltering economy and a gradually unfolding dollar crisis. Unfortunately, the full force of the Law of Progressive Ruin is yet to come.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

(HSCI), signed a contract with Japan Satellite Systems, Inc., (JSAT) of Tokyo, to build a fifth communications satellite. In December 1996, JSAT contracted for a sixth satellite. The new satellites, JCSAT-5 and JCSAT-6, are Hughes HS-601 body-stabilized model spacecraft. JCSAT-5 was successfully launched on December 2 1997 on an Ariane-44P H10-3 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. JCSAT-6 was launched 15 February 1999 from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on an Atlas-2AS rocket. These new satellites will allow JSAT to meet increased customer demand for multimedia and Internet access and will carry voice, data and television signals to Japan.\nAs Hughes HS-601 satellites, JCSAT-5 and JCSAT-6 consist of a cube-shaped center payload section, with the solar panel wings extending from the north and south sides, and an antenna array. The 601 contains two modules. The first is the bus module which carries all launch vehicle loads and contains the propulsion system, bus electronics and battery packs. The second module is the payload module, which holds communications equipment and isothermal heat pipes. Reflectors, antenna feeds, and solar arrays mount directly to the primary structure, and antenna configurations can be placed on three faces of the bus. This modular approach enables work to proceed in parallel on both structures, which shortens manufacturing and test time. JCSAT-5 and JCSAT-6 were built in the Integrated Satellite Factory of Hughes Space and Communications Company in El Segundo, Calif.\nEach satellite has a pair of four-panel sun-tracking solar array wings. Each wing extends 11.9 meters north and south from the body for an overall deployed length of 26.2 meters. These panels are designed to generate approximately 5,000 Watts with the wings deployed, using K-4 3/4 solar cells. Additionally, a single 30-cell 200 Amp-hour, nickel-hydrogen battery provides power during eclipse periods.\nThe JCSAT-5 payload consists of 32 active Ku-band transponders. There are 16 transponders operating with 27 MHz bandwidth, each with 60 Watts provided by a traveling-wave tube amplifier (TWTA); four operating with 36 MHz bandwidth, using 60 watt TWTAs; and 12 operating with 36 MHz bandwidth, each with 95 watt TWTAs. JSAT, using commands from the ground station, can combine four of the 36-Mhz transponders, resulting in two 76 MHz transponders with 95 Watts. JCSAT-6 also has 32 active Ku-band transponders with 27 MHz bandwidth, each with 75 Watts provided by a TWTA.\nJCSAT-5 and JCSAT-6 each have two octagonal reflectors, located on the east and west side of the bus. These reflectors make use of Hughes' patented shaped reflector technology, which eliminates the need for complex feedhorn arrays. With east and west reflectors deployed, the satellites measure 7.5 meters in width.\nJSAT contracted for launch directly with Arianespace for JCSAT-5 and with Lockheed Martin for JCSAT-6. After becoming operational, the satellites are refered by the designators JCSat 1B and JCSat 4A respectively.\nFor launch, the solar wings and reflectors fold alongside the spacecraft bus, forming a box 2.8 meters by 4.3 meters by 3.8 meters. After separation from the launch vehicle, the satellite's on-board 490-Newton (110 lbf) liquid apogee motor is fired to circularize the orbit at the 36,000 km (22,300 miles) geosynchronous altitude. The liquid bipropellant subsystem provides 12 thrusters of 22 Newtons (5 lbf) for stationkeeping. Once on-station, the satellites weigh approximately 1841 kg. JCSAT-5 is stationed at 150° East longitude and JCSAT-6 is at 124° East.\nOn 17. January 2005, JCSat 1B (5) experienced an anomaly in one of its thrusters, which led to temporary loss of services, while the operator prepare the satellite to operate without the faulty thruster.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

Even this rather young version, 10 years old, is an essential must in matter of whisky. The Balvenie is obviously one of the best things the Speyside area ever has produced.\nThe second tasting revealed a good whisky, with a taste close to honey, a very long finish and the whole was preceded by a pleasant smell. Without being the best of all, this bottle remains very good.\nThe complex nose mixes acid citrus fruits and sweet honey notes with some spices. In the palate, a kind of bitterness dominates at first, but gradually honey and oranges emerge. A lingering finish, with some acid touches but also some slightly woody hints.\nThe colour is amber, and the nose detects sherry, citrus fruits, honey and vanilla.\nThe palate evokes the sherry sweetness, citrus fruit and spices. The finish is long and warm.\nDuring its maturation, the whisky is transferred from a traditional oak bourbon cask in a sherry cask.\nThis different steps give the final result its quality. The traditional oak sweetens and give it some character, and the sherry cask brings the depth and plenty fragrance.\nThis great classic stays a sure value. The happiness begins by the nose... Immediately one knows there is a very great malt in the glass. The sherry finish gives the pitch and promises a great sweet whisky, aromatically very rich. The finish is also very long and extremely pleasant. An excellent Speyside, which is really affordable.\nAt the third tasting, the nose was rather discrete, revealing some floral hints on a vanilla background. In the palate, the vanilla was still present, with a touch of spices and a discrete hint of sherry. The sherry is present in the rather long finish as well. The finish is further marked by some citrus fruit hints.\nA nice nose marked by beautiful roasted barley hints with clear vanilla notes, nice hints of fruit and a hint of Marshmallow. A well balanced whisky and probably a very smooth one.\nIn the palate, nice roasted cereal hints, walnut and malt. Some chocolate too. Quite an interesting and relatively complex mouth. The balance the nose announced is perfectly confirmed in the palate.\nThe finish is smooth and lingering. The chocolate notes and the nutty hints of both the nose and mouth are plainly present here too. A very nice bottle I really recommend.\nAppearance: The colour is like concentrated apple-juice. Copper. Nose: Nice, quite citric and fresh but deep and nutty at the same time. Some rubber comes forward while new wood and curry powder lingers in the background. Lots of fruits. Diluted nose lends more fragrant notes with some feints. Body: Quite firm, full bodied but doesn't feel oily. Palate: Warm and sweet with some nuttyness. Dryer towards the finish. The nose gave a better impression than the palate.\nColour: Dark amber, (coloured or not, the label don’t say anything. But somehow it looks coloured to me, or is it from the sherry cask...?).\nFinish: Long and rich , again the same characteristic, still this nice berries, enriched with some dark chocolate and very enjoyable fine spices dancing on the tongue.\nConc.: A rich and tasty dram very much to recommend to every beginning or advanced whisky lover, very nice after a rich meal and together with tobacco, it can easily be called a “ladie’s dram”.\nVery nice sherried whisky with a lovely nose with lots of nuts and biscuits and honeyed floral nutty palate.\nNose: Lots of fruit jam (especially apricots). Marzipan and a little nutty. Playdoh playdough (first time I feel that in a whisky!). Red fruits and also some tea. Nose is really interesting and immediate.\nTaste: Quite sweet. Alcohol mastered. Aromas of red fruit and tea are the most dominant ones.\nFinish: Long and warm in continuity.\nNose: Subtle and soft, spicy and some sweetness (honey) in the background. Also some notes of wood.\nTaste: Same as the nose is the taste lovely soft and warm.\nsweetness, like liquorice and pure honey.\nFinish: Medium long and some peppery.\nNose: Fresh and tart, green apples and citrus fruits (fresh orange), Haribo crocodiles. Somewhat complex but pleasant, spring. Some spices appear at aeration (nutmeg, a pinch of white pepper). A touch of sherry?\nPalate: light, soft, and gains in power, with a nice blend of sweetness (always Haribo the crocodiles) and spicy spicy (ginger), but with a little bit of pencil.\nFinish: Quite long, pencil and slightly bitter vegetable with a little white pepper.\nConclusion: A well-made Scotch, pleasant and balanced. A drink in the spring.\nNose: Smooth, grainy, grassy, malty, with a hint of bitter smoke and some fish.\nTaste: Smooth, slightly grainy and grassy, creamy, aromatic, with some discreet peat smoke, orange, heather, pink grapefruit and custard. Rich and complex. Diluted, it becomes fruitier and more on fudge and caramel. The finish is medium, slightly bitter and citric, aromatic, on heather, tangerine, orange, fudge and some peat smoke.\nImpression: A rather pleasant, although slightly unusual whisky, on fudge and with some nice aromatic flavours.\nC : Deep gold, copper.\nN : The first nosing is fruity (red fruit in particular, berries). Typical notes from a sherry cask maturation develop (dried raisins, a hint of sulfur). It develops on citrus fruit (orange, orange peel, lemon) giving it some freshness with a hint of acidity. Light woody notes come through with time with dry fruit (hazelnuts).\nB : Smooth, still fruity, on sherry notes. Some cacao and nutty notes give it some kind of bitterness. The spices are soft.\nVery smooth with a drop of water, with some woody notes (polished wood, wax).\nF : Back to the citrus fruits with some wood.\nNose: fresh peach and a hint of citrus (orange / tangerine). Everything is still quite sweet. Aeration opens the chestnut.\nTaste: There is malt with a touch of chestnut. There is also spice and vanilla. On the palate, it lacks a bit of gluttony and amplitude relative to the nose.\nFinale: A little short, falling on the notes of vanilla and spice round (eyeing bitter almond).\nComment: The round nose is pretty damn good. Then it becomes less interesting. On the palate, it lacks body, remaining around the malt but no real imbalance. The final is cons a little short.\nFinally, a dram a little plane-plane but not unpleasant.\nThe nose starts with malt, slight burnt rubber and equally light flowers on a background of freshness due to some citrus. Traces of turpentine, salt like \"warm salt water.\" After a short time enhances the fruity and spices appear, forming a nice balance. After a long time of aeration, spice come to the fore, and the freshness resurfaced. On the palate, the attack is on the fruits and sweet spices. It is clear and precise. Peach but also spices and licorice, nuts, toffee. The final, rather short, remains on the spicy notes.\nNose: nose first mastered, on cereal, then slowly becomes fruity, pear syrup, almond, plum, chestnut cream. Over time, gaining a little density and develops notes of pastry. Odor cap bottle of red wine.\nTaste: Watery, start low, too dilute. It wins slightly later power on the same notes as the nose.\nFinale: In continuation of mouth and nose, but too strong dilution; a certain length anyway.\nComments: A very pretty nose, but a mouth and a final suffer from too strong dilution.\nThe nose reveals notes of red fruits quite raw, and a slight acidity. It is woody. It has also a little rancio. All fairly intense, reminiscent of a sherry that lacks a good dose of sugar. After a bit, the influence of sherry is more important, with chocolate and cream cake. A little frosted lemon too.\nThe palate is light on the chocolate and custard. The set is however a bit astringent. After some time in the glass, it has a little red fruit attack (strawberry) and a nice discreet as well as development of sherry. But it remains relatively average.\nThe final, of medium length, is woody with traces of coffee. It also has some citrus (lemon). It becomes softer after aeration.\nIn conclusion, a medium whisky that lacks of sweetness and personality.\nThe nose lacks a little presence. The flavors seem diluted, but they are no less interesting. It is certainly not a cask strength and sweetness dominates. Slightly bitter notes (hazelnuts, cashews) and malt. Without being spectacular, the nose is relatively complex.\nThe mouth prolongs perfectly the nose. The malty sweetness and slight bitterness are well represented, but few other flavors. Here, too, a sense of dilution rather unfortunate.\nThis is not a defect in itself, but when you usually drink the whisky at cask strength, it can disappoint.\nThe finish is slightly stronger than the mouth. still in the same vein with both bitterness and sweetness. Cashew nuts and a hint of sherry.\nIt is of medium length.\nNose: Light, fruity (pear / white peach). Indolent.\nMouth: fat and pleasant. As light as on the nose and essentially the same notes fruity. Too small.\nFinal: changing the quince paste with a touch salty. White chocolate / milk retro-olfaction.\nConclusion: Pleasant, easy to access, but does not tell much. Interested people probably beginner and having a priori as what whiskeys are bitter and strong drinks / hot.\nNose: Typical young Speysider aromas. Or let’s say entering teenage years. Poached pears. Apple crisp. A little chamomile. Quite aromatic, but remains quite basic and lacks a little oomph.\nMouth: Slightly weak indeed. Apart of that, taste is nice. Simple and sweet, with light honey and diluted orange juice.\nFinish: Clean but short. Unfortunately.\nComment: Simple but tasty, this one will be a good partner for the aperitif. Extra points for its nice fruity character, but given some extra %, this could have been a little cracker!\nNose: New make, pear brandy, cereals. Vanilla, crushed green almond. Somewhat artificial to my taste.\nMouth: The mouth is in the same line. Apple or pear spirit. Vanilla, almond. A slight taste of cardboard. Not my cup of tea. Some chemical diluted caramel. Woody bitterness and artificial at the same time.\nFinal: Medium, bitter, on chemical watery caramel.\nConclusion: Not at all my style or maybe I missed it. It seems young and diluted.\nComments: nice aperitif whisky, nothing more nothing less. Nose is better than taste. Personally I really miss a punch in this whisky, May be too gentle for me. Balvenie at 40%?\nPalate: strong attack, rapidly diminishing. Rather dry, aromas of dried fruits (apricots and raisins). Back olfactory pastry but fleeting. After aeration, softer attack, but really not so much character.\nNose: fairly balanced on honey, dried fruits, nuts and some spices.\nMouth too quiet (too thin?) there are some spices, a bit of grain and a little honey in the background but it lacks body.\nColor: light gold-orange, crystal clear.\nNose: Young fruity nose, soft spicy-malt, thin texture.\nTaste: Nothing left from the nose... hearty spice, dry, still thin, disappears quickly.\nYoung, low alcohol whisky, not much fun.\nThe very soft nose recalls precious wood (rose wood) with a touch of spices (pepper). A fragrance of ripe and fruity grape is followed by a dryer nuts one.\nThe palate is winy and fruity (orange, peach). The subtle finish is slightly bitter. Fruit touches, recalling honey and spices finish the remarkably creamy character , before the long finish, with a sweet hazelnut taste.\nAfter ageing in a traditional cask, this whisky has been transferred in a port cask (\"pipe\"). The maturation and finishing process is regularly checked..\nAt the second tasting, the nose was rather rich, sweet and spicy at the time. In the palate, this whisky is pleasant, with some citrus hints, on a malty background. Sweet with some more bitter or acid touches. A relatively short, however interesting finish.\nThe nose is very perfumed, with floral and honeyish hints. A touch of smoke too. A kind of fruity freshness. The palate is sweet as well, with a very light touch oc acidity, but it remains rather boring and monotonous. No surprise. The mouth is \"honnest\", but banal. The finish is quite long, marked by the same honeyish sweetness and the same acid touch than nose and mouth were.\nThe superb colour is old gold. The nose, smoky and slightly medicinal recalls liquorice, citrus fruits (pickled orange), ripe fruits (peach) and smooth vanilla touches.\nThe palate is even more surprising, and reveals peat, malted smoked barley, roots, and confirms the intense liquorice feeling the nose first detected.\nThe long finish goes to oily touches of flowers (broom, mimosa). The peaty character of this great whisky is much lighter as the Islay whiskies, where the sea influence is more present.\nThe whisky spent the 6 last months of its maturation in cask having contained Islay malt, after 17 years in traditional bourbon casks.\nStrange combination, the jewel of the Speyside area matured in casks having contained smoky and peaty whisky from Islay. The first contact is disconcerting. The nose offers a mix of unexpected fragrances, but is rather interesting. The palate is special too. A Speyside with Islay hints. Salt-sugared. Good whisky. An oily impression too. A finish of average length. A very good bottle.\nDuring the second tasting, a slightly acid dominant characteristic and a relatively short finish made me review my first quotation. The salted hints, inherited from the stay in Islay cask are still present.\nDuring the third tasting, this whisky seemed to be completely different from the 2 first times (own taste evolution, or action of the time on the spirit?). The nose is very fruity, revealing clearly pear fragrances and a nice complexity. In the palate, this whisky is nicely fruity and complex, mixing pear hints to clearly floral notes, on an earthy background, giving to this whisky a kind of musty impression, probably due to the influence of the Islay cask. The finish is lingering and floral, and very interesting.\nThe colour is pale gold. The nose is dry and reveals heather and exotic fruits touches. The palate, with fine wood hints confirms the nose. The finish is dry and spicy.\nThe traditional Balvenie lover can be a little thrown by this bottle, not far from a cask strength, but far from the traditional Balvenie taste. The honey sweetness is not present here. Some more acid touches, cut grass (?) or citrus fruits. The whole is rather refreshing, despite the strong alcohol degree. One would prefer a longer finish.\nJust like the first time, I was rather surprised by this very good whisky which does not taste like most of the Speyside malts. There is something special in the taste (heather?) which makes it really a whisky a part. A very good bottling.\nThe nose, revealing some remote hints of undergrowth with slight tingling's and which express a rather acid character and a wax smell is quite surprising. In the palate, this whisky is rather complex and this acidity remains together with some exotic fruits. The finish is definitely too short. A nice whisky.\nA very nice nose marked by floral notes and hints of ripe fruit. Sweet spices, cinnamon, enhance this quite remarkable nose.\nIn the palate, first impression is a kind of acidity which dominates, clearly less \"colourful\" than announced by the nose. More complexity would be appreciated.\nThe finish is fresh and rather long and prolongs the simplicity of the mouth with a predominance of acid notes and alcohol.\nNose: A little off but what stands out is rather engaging: very ripe fruit and some floral notes. Pity that is the impression they remain stuck in the glass. After aeration, the \"green\" side (more than floral plant) dominates all with some fruity notes (peach) and peppery, delicate.\nPalate: The palate is much more expressive than the nose. It is creamy, fruity to perfection, slightly acidic (English candy) and slightly vegetal. A little ginger too. In short, it is fresh and relatively complex and expressive. Okay.\nFinal: Fairly short. Or rather a bit flat. Pus on fruits (always with the head fishing) in syrup.\nConclusion: Really well done. It is precise, complex. I just wish that the nose is a little more expressive. A good 88 for Littlemill? Good potential for the opening of the bottle.\nNose: very fresh and fruity, a blend of lemon and orange. It is on a floral side that pulls the orange blossom; sweet.\nPalate: always light and fresh. Then everything becomes rounded with vanilla and light oak side. It is also mineral: on iodine; ferrous slightly.\nFinale: medium long. Fairly sweet, subtle spice stand (especially pepper).\nIt's really no wrong. It's soft and smooth and everything is melted. I'm pretty excited about all that it lacks complexity and changing tastes ets slightly marked.\nDominant profile: light, orange, vanilla, ferrous.\nNose: Smooth, sweet, very floral, slightly peaty, juicy and on pastries.\nTaste: Sweet, juicy, oaky, aromatic, slightly floral, fragrant and aromatic, on vanilla and spices. The finish is medium, on almond, rich, spicy, oaky, vanilla, some aromatic flavours and light fragrant notes.\nImpression: A nice rich, oaky and aromatic whisky with a nice complexity. Very enjoyable.\nNose: From the beginning, though strikingly fruity notes (tropical fruit). Later some more scents of barley, floral character and wild honey come up. After some time more vanilla. After tasting some more spiciness as well.\nTaste: Immediately sweet, spicy and a strong taste. But some light bitterness (wood and nutty) too.\nFinish: Fairly long, but especially spicy!\nFinish: straight not too complex, pepper, oak...finish with some water extends a bit as the pepper comes out later.\nNose: Powerful opening notes with solvent and alcohol mixed with vanilla like bourbon cask strength.\nGets fruity with ventilation (orange, ripe banana) and almost exotic (pineapple, coconut) all sprinkled with a good layer of spice with the Creole way.\nRather woody with the spices identified on the nose and a good dose of peppery mango!\nCould be a twenty years old Macduff matured in bourbon casks?\nA quite elegant nose and a nice overall balance for this whisky which lacks just a little craziness.\nFrom the start we are dealing with a very interesting nose. A subtle blend of ripe fruit and malt. Alcohol which seems perfectly integrated. However, it seems to lack a bit of complexity but has no aromatic imbalance. We can feel a hint of liquorice after a while.\nThe first impression in the mouth breaks a little the balance that had sensed at the nose. Alcohol is also much less well integrated and contrasts between dominant acid notes and hints of malt are too strong for this whisky to be excellent. It is nevertheless pleasant to drink.\nThe finish is medium in length and does not leave a lasting impression.\nNose: quite classic profile that starts quickly on freshly cut green fruit, then evolves on plum and grape. In the background, we feel dawn some nice sweet notes of barley sugar and green notes.\nPalate: The clip is less sweet and fruity than the nose. We start very quickly on woody notes (licorice stick), which then come to echo the nose ... so too discreet. malt is present, with the wood, but it lacks a little chewy and integration of alcohol can be improved in my opinion.\nFinish: The finish, it collapses. The nose does not keep its promises. It remains on alcohol, wood and lack of dimension.\nA promising nose, a nice dram but fishing a mouth that does not convince.\nNose: Quite spirity start; it fades gradually. Fairly mineral, with citrus peaks slightly pastry (shortbread). Some background spices (vanilla, cinnamon). There is also a fruity heart, with white peach, blackcurrant bud, and candied fruits. After aeration, that's fruity dominates.\nPalate: Oily, the controlled alcoholic strength. Spices, fruit, syrupy, and a bit of wood. Some tips \"salted\" too. I imagine that this whisky is relatively young (roughly ten years) and reduced.\nFinale: Medium. The aromas are collapsing too quickly. It's a shame.\nComments: A whisky without complexity, it must be admitted, but has no defects. Pleasant to drink. I guess it can be a proper daily dram. I mentioned some coastal malts from the northern Highlands. Also made me think of some Irish malts.\nThe finish is a bit short - so it is a round malt with the chance to play with water.\nNose: Smells “modern”, which means lots of vanilla, ripe banana, custard, and perhaps a little lemon curd too. Sponge cake. Sounds quite appetizing, but there’s a kind of grassy austerity that slightly puzzles me.\nMouth: Not as tantalizing as the nose. The alcohol talks louder now. Pretty well integrated, but quite hot (58% ?). Pretty naked spirit. Nicely unfolds given two drops of water.\nFinish: Short and slightly burning.\nComment: Water is mandatory here. Tastes like a young slightly shy Miltonduff.\nMouth: very creamy, again herbs, bitter and some wood, a nice dram for every day.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

He worked at Williams and Peters, his father’s firm, later becoming a partner and its president. Peters inherited $500,000 dollars upon the death of his father in 1921–the equivalent of over $6 million dollars by today’s standard–making him a very wealthy man. This fortune allowed Peters the leisure time to pursue personal and scholarly interests, in addition to his professional activities.\nPeters was an avid collector of American prints and a leading authority on Currier & Ives, a prolific American printmaking firm that was founded by Nathaniel Currier in 1934 in New York City, with James Merrit Ives joining as a partner in 1857. Peters is credited with recognizing the historic and artistic value of American lithographs during an era when they had fallen out of favor, and generating a new wave of interest by collectors and the public.\nPrint Issued by Currier & Ives. The Water Jump at Jerome Park, ca.1877. Museum of the City of New York, 57.100.83.\nPeters is the author of Currier & Ives: Printmakers to the American People (Doubleday, 1929), a “Chronicle of the Firm, and of the Artists and their Work, with Notes on Collecting,” with reproductions of select works. The two volume set is the accepted catalog raisonné of the firm’s work.\nPeters’s estate donated nearly 2,300 Currier & Ives prints to the Museum in the early 1950s. The Museum also holds a manuscript collection related to Peters’s life, work, and interests, which is believed to have been donated by his heirs around the same time. The Museum recently completed archival processing of the Peters papers thanks to the generous support of the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation.\nAs Processing Archivist Annie Tummino worked her way through the Peters papers, we discovered that in addition to his interest in American lithography, Peters was an avid sportsman, with a passion for hunting, horses, and dogs.\nFreudy Photos, Inc. [Unidentified Hunt, ca. 1930s]. Museum of the City of New York, Harry T. Peters papers.\nIn 1925 he became Co-Master of Foxhounds of the Meadow Brooke Hunt in Long Island, New York, a position he held into the 1940s. Though the “e” was dropped off the end of “Brooke” at some point, Meadow Brook Club still occupies a portion of the land on the former Foxhall Parker Keene estate near Jericho, Long Island. The Long Island Expressway now cuts across the southern end of the property, and cars stream by, rather than foxes with dogs and mounted huntsmen in hot pursuit as they did in Peters’s day. Peters was also a member of the Westminster Kennel Club and often served as an exhibitor and judge at dog shows.\nHunt map, Meadow Brooke Hounds, 1933. Museum of the City of New York, Harry T. Peters papers.\nIn processing the Peters papers, we found it was often difficult to draw a line between Peters’s work as a scholar and collector of lithography, and his personal interests and hobbies. Two such examples include a lecture titled “Sport in Art through the Ages,” and his text Just Hunting.\nUnknown photographer. [“Sport in Art” at the Metropolitan Museum, 1937]. Museum of the City of New York, Harry T. Peters papers.\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art sponsored the exhibition of sporting art in March 1937, with paintings and prints dating from the Middle Ages. Building on this event, Peters developed “Sport In Art Through the Ages,” an illustrated lecture which he delivered at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and later at the Grolier Club, an organization devoted to the “study, collecting, and appreciation of books and works on paper, their art, history, production, and commerce.” Shortly thereafter, Peters began a full length work on the same topic that was never published.\nPotential titles for “Just Hunting,” ca. 1935, in the Harry T. Peters papers. Museum of the City of New York.\nPeters did finish a book titled Just Hunting, which was published in 1935 by Scribner’s (New York), and provides personal and historical perspectives on the subject. The book was illustrated by amateur artist and Long Island resident Betty Babcock. Ernest R. Gee later published Babcock’s Illustrated Hunting Diary, Recording the Sport of the Season for the Followers of the Meadow Brook Hounds (circa 1945).\nIllustration layout for “Just Hunting,” 1935, in the Harry T.

My husband and I are really into our coffee, so I enjoy the process of making it—and drinking it. Then, the next few hours are really devoted to getting my kids up and out. Sometimes, I don’t even look in the mirror until I’m home from dropping them off [at school]; I just throw on something easy.

A Quantity Surveyor will visit your property, determine your exact requirements.\nOnce we have this information, we will arrange for 3 reputable and respected conservatory companies to get back to you with fixed quotes.\nYou can either employ the quantity surveyor to project manage the building of your conservatory, or you can use the quotes to choose the best service and manage everything yourself.\nAn experienced quantity surveyor has years of experience in the industry, and they will be able to identify any potential problems early in the process. They will agree prices and deadlines and ensure that the construction company meets them. They will prevent additional costs and delays, and will be responsible for dealing with all suppliers and contractors during the completion of the project.\nConservatories became popular during the economic crisis. They offered a more cost-effective means of increasing living space without having to sell an existing property and buy a new one. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, which means that custom built conservatories can be used for unusual spaces, and small conservatories can be added even when space is limited.\nAs well as being affected by the design and dimensions, the position of the conservatory, and the materials that are used, the additional features in your conservatory will have a direct impact on the cost that you pay for your completed room. For example, if you want to incorporate central heating into your room, this increases cost.\nAlthough conservatory costs can vary dramatically, you should expect to pay between £4,000 and £7,000 for a small, standard sized, lean-to conservatory.\nVictorian conservatories will cost around £6,000 to £10,000 for the simplest and cheapest option, while P-shape and L-shape conservatories attract a minimum cost of £15,000.\nCosts can rise considerably if you have unique requirements or need any unusual elements.\nThe primary benefit of installing new conservatories is the additional living space that it affords the homeowner. The room can be used for anything from a sun room or study to a gym or games room.\nA new conservatory is likely to be cheaper than selling your existing home and moving into a new property, while still enabling you to scale up.\nIf the conservatory matches the style of the rest of the property and offers genuine value to the homeowner, it could increase property value by as much as 7% of the property valuation.\nA conservatory enables you to bring the outdoors inside. The glass windows and translucent roof mean that you can enjoy the sun all year round, while the natural wooden design that is common means that you can add wicker furniture and plants to give the conservatory a real outdoor feel.\nDifferent styles of conservatory have different benefits and potential uses.\nThe lean-to conservatory is a simple conservatory and is usually the cheapest option available. The pitched roof slopes away from the wall, and these conservatories are typically used to extend the rear of a property and protrude from the main house. However, if you have an L shaped property rear, you can use the conservatory to fill in the blank space.\nThe Victorian conservatory is the most popular style available. It suits all property styles and shapes. It features a bay front and a steeply pitched roof. It also includes a detailed ridge design, and this is the style that instantly springs to mind when most people hear the word conservatory.\nThe Edwardian conservatory, which may also be called the Georgian conservatory, has become increasingly popular. It has a square or rectangular shape, which gives it convenient dimensions for laying out furniture and other accessories. There is no wasted space, and the sloping roof gives the Edwardian sun room real impact.\nA P-Shape conservatory combines a lean-to and Victorian conservatory design. This type of design suits larger properties that have a lot of outdoor space available for use. The Victorian element of the conservatory design can be three-faceted or five-faceted. Because this, and the L-Shape conservatory below, extends in two different directions, it offers the versatility to incorporate two separate living spaces in your new property addition.\nAn L-Shape conservatory offers many of the same benefits as a P-Shape room; potentially more so. It combines a rectangular lean-to design with a square or rectangular Edwardian design. The straight lines mean that furniture can be pushed to the edge of the room, and no space is wasted.\nThere are a lot of potential uses for a conservatory. It acts as a compromise between a full extension and no extension whatsoever. It can also work as a compromise between outdoor and indoor space. Add some plants and natural materials and it will feel as though you’re sat in the garden rather than in a newly extended section of the house.\nCreate a new dining room with stunning views. Dining rooms can be quite dark and enclosed, and they tend to have multiple uses – they are games rooms to keep the kids out of the living room, they are homework rooms, computer rooms, and they offer an area to sit and eat.

{"best_of": 1, "echo": true, "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 0, "model": "opt-1.5b", "n": 1, "prompt": "If the meaning of morality is both discovered and created in the narration of our lives and the revelation of the divine, it must also be applied to the situations of our individual and corporate living.\nIn this session we will explore the nature of appropriating ethical understandings and to what degree we as human beings are free to take responsibility for our appropriation. We will also continue the analysis of your dilemma by addressing issues of institutional structures which affect our freedom and will to act.\nFor Christian (and others) today, the word responsibility is closely associated with words like moral and good. Thus, we speak of being a responsible person, spouse, friend, citizen; of being a responsible church or society; and now, of being a responsible species. What is implicit in the notion that human beings are responsible beings is that we are engaged in a dialogue, or a relationship, with others (other people and things) that demands our response. It is difficult to understand the meaning of responsibility if we conceive of human beings as totally independent, being and acting in the world unconnected to anything or anyone else. If that were the case, we would have little use for the notion of responsibility at all. To embrace the idea of responsibility, in a very real sense, means we acknowledge that as individuals and communities we are in relationships and that all our endeavors toward character and all our decisions leading to actions are a response to being in relationship.\nH. Richard Niebuhr was a leading Christian theologian who defined and established the Responsibility school of thought in Christian ethics. Niebuhr spoke of the moral responsibility of an individual and a community as involving response, interpretation, accountability, and social solidarity.\nNiebuhr says, \"The first element in the theory of responsibility is the idea of response. All action, we now say, including what we rather indeterminately call moral action, is response to action upon us. We do not, however, call the action of a self or moral action unless it is response to interpreted action upon us\" (1963:61). In other words, to say that responsibility is response is not enough. We recognize, for example, that many of our physical reactions (from a heartbeat to a sudden fright) are reflexive and thus would not be identified as responsible in an ethical sense. We do not call a responsive attitude or action moral unless it were self-aware and an interpretation of the situation in which we find ourselves.\nWe can approach the questions \"Who shall I (we) be and what shall I (we) do?\" in many different ways. If we used a teleological approach we would also ask \"What is my (our) goal, ideal, or telos?\" If we used a deontological approach we would ask \"What is the first law (duty) in my life and what are the laws (duties) that apply here?\" If we used a responsibility approach we would first ask \"What is going or what it being done to me (us)?\" In very general terms, teleology is primarily concerned with the good, deontology with the right, and an ethics of responsibility with what is fitting (1963:60-61). However, many ethicists would say that what is fitting, that is to say a response that, through self-awareness and interpretation, takes account of the wholeness of the situation and fits into the possibilities of interaction, response and counter response, would also be good and right.\nA third element is accountability -- a word that is frequently defined by recourse to legal thinking but that has a more definite meaning, when we understand it as referring to a part of the response pattern of our self-conduct. Our actions are responsible not only insofar as they are reactions to interpreted actions upon us but also insofar as they are made in anticipation of answers to our answers. An agent's action is like a statement in a dialogue. Such a statement not only seeks to meet, as it were, or to fit into, the previous statement to which it is an answer, but is made in anticipation to reply. It looks forward as well as backward; it anticipates objections, confirmations, and corrections. It is made as part of a total conversation that leads forward and is to have meaning as a whole (1963:63-64).\nAccountability implies that our development of character and actions must be aware of the past, interpret the present, and attempt to anticipate the future. We must anticipate the consequences of our selves and our actions, that is to try, as best we can, to anticipate the affect of our actions and responses on others and their choices and actions.\nAnd finally, if accountability is anticipating the reactions of our reactions, Niebuhr would say that responsibility also includes the presumption of social solidarity. He says, \"Our action is responsible, it appears, when it is response to action upon us in a continuing discourse or interaction among beings forming a continuing society\" (1963:65). We are responsible beings, when we embrace the virtues and actions that, not only benefit ourselves, but also the relationships and the communities in which we live; and as we discussed in the previous section, also embrace God's and intentions for humankind (both as individuals and communities) and all of creation.\nBy turning to Dietrich Bonhoeffer we can extend our notion of responsibility. Bonhoeffer says the responsible life consists of two factors; \"life is bound to man and to God and a man's own life is free. It is a fact that life is bound to man and to God which sets life in the freedom of a man's own life. Without this bond and without this freedom there is no responsibility\" (1955:224). For Bonhoeffer responsibility consists primarily of our relationship with God and our freedom.\nThe 'world' is thus the sphere of concrete responsibility which is given to us in an through Jesus Christ. It is not some general concept from which it is possible to derive a self-contained system. A man's attitude to the world does not correspond with reality if he sees in the world a good and evil which is good or evil in itself, or if he sees in it a principle which is compounded of both good and evil and if he acts in accordance with this view; his attitude accords with reality only if he lives and acts in limited responsibility and thereby allows the world ever anew to disclose its essential character to him.\nAction which is in accordance with reality is limited by our creatureliness (1955:233).\nAt this point we begin to sense that when freedom is intimately bonded to relationship, a paradox arises. If we say human beings are limited and bound in relationship, what does it mean to also say human beings are free? Bonhoeffer says, \"Responsibility and freedom are corresponding concepts\" and that \"responsibility presupposes freedom and freedom can consist only in responsibility. Responsibility is the freedom of men which is given only in the obligation of God and neighbour.\" (1955:248). So, our freedom (what Bonhoeffer calls \"entire freedom\") finds its meaning in obligation to God and to each other as understood and challenged in life of Jesus Christ.\nIn recent years one of the most dominant concerns occupying ethics has been the notion of freedom. It is easy to say that we have free choice; free choice in the market, in religion, in relationships, etc. It is easy to say we are free to become the person we want to be. It can even be said we are free to choose our morality from a supermarket of selection; indeed, in this Module you have been introduced to a number of ethical schools of thought and moral possibilities - deontology, teleology, situationalism, existentialism, responsibility ethics, Christian ethics, biblical ethics, etc. Is it enough to say that an authentic morality is one that you freely choose and take responsibility for your choice?\nStanley Hauerwas points out that as we fly the flag of freedom, we live in a world where we recognize and accept every increasing areas of determinism. Science has reduced human nature and action to simple matter of genetic, biochemical, environmental, psychological, sociological factors. It has been said that one of the defining characteristics of modernity is that people feel both free and determined. Paradoxically, in a world of every increasing choices (from breakfast cereals to philosophies/theologies of life) the one thing we hold unto is our own autonomy as free selves (1983:7).\nHauerwas quotes the sociologist Peter Berger as saying we are condemned to a concept of freedom where \"freedom of choice\" becomes a virtue in and of itself. Thus, Hauerwas himself says, \"It matters not what we desire, but that we desire. Our task is to become free, not through the acquisition of virtue, but by preventing ourselves from being determined, so that we can always keep our 'options open'\" (1983:8). He would suggest that by ignoring the people we want to be and are becoming (that is our character), and by ignoring the fact that morality is retrospective (remembering and accepting), we fall into a trap of individualism and self-deception. As individuals we 'forget' that our freedom of choice and, by necessity, our will impinges on others. This act of forgetting is an act of self-deception. Hauerwas goes so far as to say that \"there is no morality that does not require others to suffer for our commitments\" (1983:9). Ethically speaking, freedom, like responsibility, is living within relationships, where response, self-awareness, interpretation, and accountability are necessary.\nAs we noted above in our discussion of Bonhoeffer's understanding of responsibility and freedom, within a Christian perspective both responsibility and freedom find their meaning when understood in relation to God and God's intention for creation. As such, an ethic of responsibility finds meaning in its relationship to obedience and discipleship. We believe it to be so because we believe that Jesus Christ stood before God as one both obedient and free. Freedom without obedience is merely and expression of self-will and individualistic choice for the sake of choice alone. Obedience without freedom is slavery.\n...the Lord has told us what is good. What he requires of us is this: to do what is just, to show constant love, and to live in humble fellowship with our God (1994:903).\nIf you obey my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father's commands and remain in his love. I have told you this so your joy may be complete. My commandment is this: love one another, just as I love you (1994:138).\nAn ethic of responsibility would argue that being a person of justice and love, and acting justly and lovingly, is to embrace both fidelity and freedom, which is to say responsibility. A Christian ethic of responsibility would argue that one can only realize a just and loving character, and make just and loving decisions, if our being is grounded in a relationship with God and our neigbhour, and benefits God's intentions for all of creation.\nFinally, quoting the Scripture above reminds us that Christian ethics does not begin by \"emphasizing rules or principles, but by calling our attention to a narrative that tells of God's dealing with creation\" (Hauerwas 1983:24-25). As was mentioned in Session 2, narrative is neither incidental nor accidental to Christian belief. Hauerwas insists that narrative, first \"formally displays our existence and that of the world as creatures -- as contingent beings\"; second, that narrative \"is the characteristic form of our awareness of ourselves as historical beings\"; and third, that God has \"revealed himself narratively in the history of Israel and in the life of Jesus\" (1983:28-29).\nWith the rise of a scientific understanding and approach to reality the concept of what it is to be human has fundamentally changed. These changes are not easily reconciled with the biblical world nor with most of Church history. Much of the contemporary understanding of human nature would seem to \"limit\" our freedom and, thus, our responsibility. Below are listed four very brief sketches of contemporary constraints on human freedom and responsibility.\nBiological Constraints: If, as Darwin suggests, we are evolved then we, like all animals, will be governed by genetic and bio-chemical realities. It is suggested (and assumed by many) that anger, greed, love, compassion, etc., are evolutionary developments and bio-chemical responses. It is believe today that once we have genetically mapped the human body, human nature will be understood.\nPhysical Constraints: More recent studies have suggested that much of our behaviour is determined, or affected by diet, exercise, stress, etc.\nPsychological Constraints: Psychoanalysis, Behavourism, Self-Actualization, etc., are all attempts to define human behaviour, solve behavioural defects, and assure the well-being and good health of human beings. While these methods differ widely, they all suggest that human behaviour can be explained and understood scientifically.\nSocial Constraints: Sociologists and anthropologists have gone some way in describing the effects of socialization on human beings. All human beings live in a social context and are accountable to laws, role expectations, the pressures and protections of conformity, etc.\nHow do the theological notions discussed above interact with the contemporary scientific \"explanations\" of human nature, as just described?\nGiven your Christian theological and ethical understandings, and the contemporary understanding human nature, discuss in what ways human beings can be held ethically responsible for their actions.\nGiven our contemporary understanding of human nature and the moral life, how are we responsible to God and our neighbour? In what ways does our relationship with God as created beings influence your understandings?\nConsider any role expectations that may affect your ethical dilemma. These expectations will lead you into further considerations of character. What virtues are relevant in your dilemma and how might they affect your choice of actions. In what ways does your professional role affect issues of character and virtue? Anticipating your ordination, does being a minister make a difference in the resolution of your ethical dilemma and to you personally as a human being?\nBeing a minister is just as important as doing ministry; or, in ministry we are not just concerned with what we do, but how we do it. We imagine ourselves as certain kinds of people and the kinds of people we want to become. Thus, a minister is not only expected to tell the truth, but also to be a truthful person. We must be people of integrity. \"Character gives continuity from one action to another. While actions may be discrete, the person or moral agent who is the same person. Her or his different actions over time must somehow fit into a whole that makes sense\" (Lebacqz 1985:81).\nRuth wanted to be fair, honest, trustworthy. To be trustworthy meant more than just keeping confidence. \"The trustworthy person does not simply keep confidence, but is thoughtful about the impact of her decisions on others, sensitive to their needs and claims...\" (Lebacqz 1985:79). So, Ruth had to be concerned with the \"depth\" of her actions. She was also concerned with the \"breadth\" of her actions, however, or the \"continuity over time between this decision and others (Lebacqz 1985:80). Thus, Ruth was interested in considering how any particular decision would impact her situations and relationships in the future. What would it mean to keep confidence if Kathy went ahead with an abortion? What effect would breaking confidence have on her relationship with Kathy and/or other church members?\npattern of actions in our lives. We must always ask if such a pattern makes sense, or fits in with the image, or story, of our life. How do our actions fit the virtues, or character traits, which define us?\n\"Patterns of action over time form the basis for our judgments about a person's character and virtue\" (Lebacqz 1985:93). It is, therefore, important to know what virtues are relevant in any particular situation and thus might lend some guidance to the right action. Thus, though Ruth may have a rule that tells her to keep confidence and be a member of a profession that more tightly binds her to keeping confidence, she must also consider still deeper questions asking what actions \"are consonant with the kinds of virtues she wants to develop as a professional\" (Lebacqz 1985:106).", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

They&apos;re playing well together,\" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said about the Spurs. \"The few days of good practice they had and we took days off showed.\"\nSan Antonio connected on four of its first six shots from the floor while the Raptors went just 1-for-6 from the field to give the Spurs an early 9-3 lead.\nToronto netted the next five points to close its gap to one, but the Raptors would get no closer until Johnson later capped a 6-0 push with a layup to knot the game at 16-16 with a little over two minutes left in the first quarter.\nThe Spurs, however, scored six of the final eight points of the frame and carried a 22-18 lead into the second quarter.\nToronto followed Stephen Jackson&apos;s opening basket of the second with an 11-3 spurt to take its first lead of the game at 29-27.\nThe lead would exchange hands three times from there as the teams traded blows, with the last coming on a pair of Danny Green free throws as part of a 14-4 run by the Spurs over the final three-plus minutes of the half to give them a 44-37 advantage at the break.\nAfter Duncan drained a jumper to start the scoring in the third quarter, the Raptors battled back with an 11-5 push to get within 51-48.\nSan Antonio responded with six straight points to regain a nine-point edge and following a brief 5-0 spurt by Toronto that brought the Raptors back within 57-53, the Spurs closed out the third with a 13-4 run to take a 70-57 lead into the fourth quarter.\nToronto never threatened in the final stanza, trailing by double digits throughout the entire fourth quarter.\n\"I thought our defense was very good in the second half,\" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. \"They did a much better job in the pick-and-roll and our pace was better offensively.

{"best_of": 1, "echo": true, "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 0, "model": "opt-1.5b", "n": 1, "prompt": "If you know what you’re doing, it can be quite Easy to Clean Fitted Crib Sheets and other kinds of sheets and comforters. As a parent, you have to take care of your kid’s beddings to make sure they are clean at all times. Sheets and comforters can gather dust easily and you should try to change them every week. There are easy ways to clean sheets that would make them last longer and retain their quality and freshness. It goes beyond just throwing them in the washer. Below we discuss the best ways to clean fitted sheets and other kinds of sheets as well.\nWhen doing laundry, pay attention so you don’t leave your sheets in the washer or dryer after the wash cycle is done. Leaving them to sit in the dryer or washer will cause them to wrinkle up. You do not want to go through the hassle of ironing your fitted sheets especially if it’s a large household with lots of sheets. Take the sheets out of the dryer immediately and if you want to ensure they remain straight and without wrinkles, spread them out on the bed to cool. This will leave them looking ironed and feeling brand new.\nThis is very important when you are washing fitted sheets and flat sheets that will be used to dress a baby’s crib or a toddlers bed. It is also important for adults as well. Harsh detergents can damage the sheets and they can also cause irritation to the skin – even more so for babies that have sensitive and delicate skin. Try to use gentler detergents or natural detergents and not only will they extend the life of your sheets, but they will also not pose a threat to your skin or your baby’s skin. Also be careful fo the detergent you buy, some have weird coloring or really cheap chemicals that just straight up damage your clothes.\nI get tempted to put the wash cycle on very hot a lot because it makes me feel like the hot water cleans the clothes the best. This might be true for some situations but not for fitted sheets, When you wash fitted sheets and flat sheets in hot water and then tumble dry them in dry heat it will lead to the sheets shrinking. You might not notice it after the first couple of times but constantly doing this will cause your fitted sheets to get smaller and smaller and soon you just realize they don’t fit anymore and you have to get new ones. If you just can’t do without washing your fitted sheets at high temperature, then you can buy sheets that are a size or two bigger.\nWashing your fitted sheets without washing the duvet cover and the flat sheet kind of defeats the purpose. The bed will still be dirty and it might cause the fitted sheets to get dirty quicker. Try to wash the duvet cover every two weeks or once a month if you don’t have the time.\nA down comforter is very comfortable and its one of the best options for staying warm in bed during the cold months like in autumn and winter. A comforter might not be able to provide much comfort if it’s not properly cared for. A down comforter is made up of light feathers that are stitched together in a patter. They are usually quite heavy so you will need a heavy duty and large capacity washing machine to clean them properly. If you do not have this size washing machine at home, then you can take your down comforter to the laundromat. Attempting to wash a down comforter in a small machine that does not fit is a bad idea.\nWhen washing, wash them in a gentle cycle and use a mild detergent. Also, don’t use a lot of detergents, a small amount is best. Too much detergent might cause the down to strip away. For a down comforter, it is better to rinse it in two cycles to make sure all the soap is rinsed out. For drying purposes, a low capacity dryer is a bad idea. Use a high capacity dryer and put it on low heating so the dryer is gentle on the comforter.\nMake sure the comforter is dried properly otherwise it could lead to a moldy situation with the feathers. While drying, pause the dryer a few times and take the comforter out to give it a fluff. You could get the kids in the house to help with this as they will love it. Unlike skeets and duvet covers, you should wash your down comforters once a year. If this sounds like too much hassle, then take your down cover to professional to get it professionally cleaned and taken care of.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

It introduces key terms and activities required for promotion, with special emphasis on establishing an independent research program. You'll also find tips for avoiding common pitfalls.\npromotion - An advancement in rank. The two key promotions are from Assistant to Associate and from Associate to Full Professor.\nmerit increase - An advancement in salary step (e.g., Assistant Step 2 to Assistant Step 3). A faculty member is eligible for a normal merit increase every 2 years in the Assistant Professor and Associate Professor ranks and every 3 years in the Professor rank.\n4th year appraisal - An evaluation of the faculty member's readiness for promotion from Assistant to Associate at the next review (in 2 years). Typically, the appraisal occurs at the review for a merit increase from Assistant Step 3 to Assistant Step 4, with anticipation that the next step would be promotion to Associate Step 1.\ncross-over merit increase - An increase in step within a lower rank instead of promotion to the higher rank. This can occur if the faculty member is deemed not ready for promotion, but likely to be ready in 2 years. For example, advancement to Assistant Step 5 instead of Associate Step 1 is a cross-over merit. Because the salary scales are similar, the effect of this is to advance the salary step while delaying the promotion. When the promotion happens, it is usually to the second step of the new rank, so that the salary progression is maintained.\nacceleration - Skipping a Step. Example: advancing directly from Professor Step 3 to Step 5.\nadvancement to Professor Step 6 - A career review and often considered a promotion.\nadvancement from Professor Step 9 to Off-Scale - Also a career review, and typically does not happen until the faculty member has four years at Step 9.\nIn the UC system, the final decision about faculty advancement does not lie within the faculty member's department, but rather with the Committee on Academic Personnel (CAP), a committee composed of faculty members from across the University departments. When you are eligible for an advancement, you will be asked to prepare a file supporting that advancement. Your file is first considered by the Radiology Advancement and Promotions Committee (RADAPC) to determine if the advancement is appropriate based on the departmental guidelines. For promotions, external referee letters will be requested to evaluate your work. The full file, including outside letters and the departmental recommendation, is then submitted to CAP for a decision. It is important to note that CAP may not agree with the departmental recommendation. They may determine that teaching or service are not at a sufficient level, but their most common grounds for denying an advancement are a lack of independent scholarly productivity.\nThe best way to advance successfully is to establish a focused body of independent work that is clearly yours and is considered important to your field. The significance of your research must be documented by strong evidence such as published papers, grants as PI, and external referee letters that show that your work is respected in your field. Typically, papers are especially persuasive because they directly represent your scholarly contributions. They are also critical: Without papers, it is difficult to get grants and harder for external reviewrs to recognize your contributions.\nPublished papers: Your goal is to demonstrate scholarly independence. This means you need primary papers where your \"ownership\" is clear as corresponding author, first author, or senior author with a student or fellow as first author. At the Assistant level, first author papers often carry the most weight. Multiple papers focused in one area are important because they demonstrate a coherent body of research. Many papers on which you are a co-author in a middle author position can be evidence that your skills are important to a larger research program, but they do not demonstrate your scholarly independence.\nGrants: Although grants as PI are not strictly required, they are good evidence that your work has been critically evaluated and deemed important to your field. Grants are not in themselves a scholarly contribution, however, so they cannot substitute for published papers.\nLetters from external reviewers: Strong letters are critical because they directly represent the way your work is perceived and valued in your field. Letters are obtained for all promotions. Typically, half of the reviewers are suggested by the candidate and half are selected by the department.\nIn a Professor track, you must teach. Teaching/mentoring comes in several modes, all of which must be documented on the Teaching forms you prepare for your file. All categories of teaching are combined into a single \"Teaching Credit\" number. The minimum requirement, corresponding to one course per year, is a teaching credit of about 100. Think of this as a bare minimum—more credits are highly desirable. While teaching graduate students and postdocs within the lab may suffice, it is better to do some teaching in established courses (with a UCSD course number), as well.\nFor all teaching activities, documented evidence in the form of teaching evaluations is critical. If you are teaching in a course, be sure to arrange with the instructor of record to get copies of your teaching evaluations. For one-on-one teaching or mentoring, letters are important. When you submit your file, include a list of individuals who could write testimonials about your teaching/mentoring abilities. When you are on clinical service, you will receive evaluations from the residents and fellows.\nAll clinical faculty participate in radiology coverage with appropriate clinical work for their section/division. Part of any radiologist's role is being a consultant to the clinical services and contributing to their clinical conferences.\nService can include many activities that involve contributing your time and effort, such as managing a research facility, working on department or university committees, working for scientific organizations, organizing scientific meetings, serving as an editor on a journal, reviewing papers for journals in your field, serving on advisory boards, and providing service to the community.\nAn unsuccessful promotion submission often fails to meet one of two key criteria: Research independence and strong external letters.\nThe key requirement for promotion is demonstrated scholarly independence. Establishing your independence can be a particular problem if you work within a larger research group. If your work could be interpreted as lacking scholarly independence for any of the reasons below, you should carefully address the issue in the Self-Assessment you prepare for your file (See Strengthening Your Self-Assessment, coming in late April), for tips on addressing potential concerns in your file).\nLack of primary papers as first, senior, or corresponding author. Primary papers are the standard measure of independent scholarly work. If you have alternative scholarly work, you need to carefully justify why that work is equivalent to publishing scientific papers. Note that publishing many papers as a collaborating author cannot substitute for primary papers and may even heighten the sense of a lack of primary papers.\nLack of concentration of your primary papers. If your primary papers are in several areas, it can be difficult to see a coherent research program that is important to your field. In addition, letters from external reviewers tend to be stronger when they can identify a clear body of work.\nPrevious mentors are a co-author on your primary papers. If a senior scientist, particularly one who served in a mentoring capacity in the early stages of your career, is a co-author on your primary papers (especially in the senior author position), CAP often questions whether there is real independence. In other words, CAP tends to want to see a sharp distinction between work you do in a mentored capacity (as a graduate student, postdoc, etc) and work you do as an independent faculty member.\nYour funded work is not independent research. It is not uncommon for an individual to be appointed Assistant Professor with funding coming from grants with a senior scientist as PI with the expectation that the individual will provide effort and expertise for that larger research program. This could lead you to be a co-author on many papers but not as first or last author, and CAP does not consider these papers to be evidence of scholarly independence. CAP is looking for an independent research program. This scenario can create a tension between work that you must do to justify your funding, and work you need to do to establish your independent research program and earn promotion in a Professor series. If you recognize this potential tension early on, you can work with the PIs on the grants that support you to plan ways to establish your independence. Specifically, you must publish your own work without the more senior researchers as co-authors.\nOutside letters are critically important for promotion. They provide key evidence for the independence of your work, the importance of your work, and your role in your field. A weak letter often occurs when an independent reviewer cannot distinguish your work from that of a more senior colleague. For example, if a more senior researcher known to be the leader of a large and productive lab is always the senior author on your papers, the reviewer may praise your work as a key supporting effort in the exceptional work being done in the senior researcher's lab. This will hurt your chances of promotion because it reinforces the perception of a lack of independence in your own work. For this reason, it is important for you to establish a presence in your field based on work that is clearly your own independent research.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

Electrons are fired at a bulb coated in phosphors which are excited and emit light. The effect is a “natural light,” which is the same as a traditional incandescent, Styles said.\n“It’s basically old technology that everybody just gave up on some years ago because it’s based on the TV side, not lighting,” he said.\nBecause of the phosphors Vu1 is using, it can better match the light spectrum of incandescent light than competing technologies, Styles said.\nIts first product, which Vu1 intends to start making early next year, is an R30 floodlight for recessed cans which produces as much light as a 65-watt incandescent at 870 lumens while consuming 19 watts. An Energy Star-compliant compact fluorescent light with similar output consumes about 13 watts. But unlike compact fluorescent bulbs, Vu1 bulbs will not have mercury. The cost is projected to be under $20, said Styles.\nAnd now the day has come!\nWell, almost… Last Friday, ahead of official launch date, Lowe’s started selling the long-awaited Vu1 lamps online (for a lower price than projected, $14.98) but only a few lucky buyers were able to place an order. Yesterday, the Vu1 corporation CEO issued a letter explaining why. It seems Lowe’s need to revamp their website to create a new product category since the Vu1 will not fit into existing lamp categories. Once that’s taken care of, online order should work again.\nEarly reports from those who received their bulbs are mostly positive regarding light quality. (I’ll be back with a review if I can get hold of one myself.) Update: seems that may be several years down the line as they are not yet produced for European mains voltage.\nUpdate Aug 2012: The Vu1 lamp has received much positive attention but the company seems to still have problems delivering the lamps to U.S. retail stores, so eager consumers have to be very patient.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

In reality, many have origins dating back hundreds of years. All we’ve done is replicate the fads of our forefathers, only this time, we have the benefit of the Internet to make them spread faster and on a wider scale.\nPhotographing felines in ridiculous outfits and placing even more ridiculous captions on said pictures goes back to Victorian times, to the studios of Harry Pointer and Harry Frees. These photographers separately took photos of cats and other animals in human-like poses and sold them for postcards and children’s books. It was hard work, as the photographers had to make do with primitive equipment while also keeping the live animals still long enough for the perfect pose.\nOne of their contemporaries, taxidermist Walter Potter, had no such difficulties. During his career, Potter mounted countless dead small animals, including rats, cats, and rabbits in poses just like miniature humans.\nTheir bizarre work still could not compare to the eccentric artwork of the painter Louis Wain. Wain reportedly suffered from schizophrenia throughout his life, which would explain why he painted almost nothing but anthropomorphic cats.\nAt some point, we may have all encountered that smug smiling face of Alfred E. Neuman coupled with the usual caption of “What, Me Worry?” Although named and made famous by Mad Magazine in the 1950s, the figure’s roots are steeped in racism against the Irish during their mass migration to the US in the 18th and 19th centuries.\nDuring that time, the Irish were depicted though a variety of stereotypes, such as violent drunks, low-brow hooligans, and secret agents of their country or the Pope. These stereotypes were usually drawn with monkey faces, a common feature that would evolve into Neuman’s “grinning idiot” face.\nThe “What, Me Worry” caption was added to this character in 1911 through the racially charged book Wurra-Wurra: A Legend of St. Patrick at Tara. The book depicted Irishmen as worrywarts who liked to pray constantly to their god Wurra-Wurra (the word sounding like a Gaelic prayer to the Virgin Mary).\nLOLspeak, the ever-addicting error-filled language of the Internet era, has a predecessor in the form of comical abbreviations. This trend among newspapers in the 1830s and ’40s first started in Boston and made its way to other publications across the country. Comical abbreviations shortened words that were also deliberately misspelled (“nuff said” became “NS”). In place of good, clean fun, however, newspapers wrote the abbreviations mainly to mock poor people and their illiteracy.\nPicture the typical keyboard warrior, all bundled up in a nice, comfy chair but talking smack like an action hero. That’s exactly what the ancient Greeks and Romans did in their time, except that they scribbled their posts on walls and virtually any other surface they could find. With the trash-talking also came regular posts about an individual’s sexual exploits (and his rival’s lack thereof), although plenty of messages also covered heavy topics such as love and philosophy.\nAside from the mundane trolling and exaggerated posting, evidence says that messages were well regulated, especially on walls found in the homes of the wealthy. Just like a forum moderator, the owner controlled who could post a message on his wall. This setup gave him leverage over political candidates who generally favored the walls of the wealthy but would have to first ask permission before posting campaign advertisements.\nPredictions about the end of the world are a dime a dozen throughout different civilizations and timelines. The Toledo Letter, however, was the first documented case of an end-of-the-world scare truly going viral.\nSpread around Europe in 1184 and supposedly written by monks, the letter predicted that the apocalypse would happen in September 1186, the event being preceded by the ominous aligning of the planets “in the sign of the Scales and in the tail of the Dragon.” After that, various natural disasters would commence, and the only way for people to survive would be to flee to the mountains.\nThe letter caused massive panic throughout the continent, with even the Archbishop of Canterbury announcing a 72-hour fast to avert the doomsday prediction. Although the planets did align as predicted, the disaster never happened. Still, we all know that one doomsday prediction failure can never stop the proliferation of countless others.\nThe phrase “flash mob” entered the popular lexicon in 2003 with the first known attempt in Manhattan, New York. Its real meaning, however—which is undisputedly raunchier—goes further back in time to another continent, specifically to when Australia was still largely a penal colony in the 19th century.\nA group of women convicts in Hobart Town, Tasmania flashed their derrieres at a certain Reverend William Bedford while he held a service for them inside the prison, ostensibly protesting his insincerity and their deplorable working conditions. Due to their overwhelming numbers, authorities failed to find and punish the ringleaders. However, not all found the event insulting. The governor’s wife, who was also attending the service, had to struggle to control herself before making it back to her carriage, at which point she burst out laughing.\nAnyone with an email address or social networking account is bound to get a chain letter. Far from being a child of the Internet age, however, this annoying trend began as early as the late 19th century. The first known example was a solicitation letter with the signature of a “Mrs. George O. Haman” of Sherwood, Tennessee. The letter appealed to kind souls to donate 10 cents so that she could fund the education of impoverished white children in Appalachia.\nThe letter contained her address and instructions for it to be duplicated and sent to four other people. In contrast to chain mails of today, the letter promised to bless the compliant receiver rather than curse those who ignore it. The use of threats became more prevalent especially during the Depression era.\nWe might think that people’s never-ending obsession of taking pictures of themselves began with the digital age and reflects a new level of narcissism. According to one researcher, however, the art of taking selfies could actually be attributed to the mirror fad that hit the medieval era.\nArt historian James Hall says that people’s fascination with mirrors provided the spark later on for self-portraits done by artists starting in the 12th century. The only difference is that those self-portraits were actually a means of self-reflection in accordance with Christian teachings of that era and not just another way of getting attention.\nHall cites Jan van Eyck’s “Arnolfini Portrait” and postulates that the painting’s mirrors represent a guide to knowing oneself better. These self-portraits enabled subjects to contemplate and criticize their innermost selves. The trend of “selfless” self-portraits gradually faded out by the 20th century, giving us the shallow selfies of today.\nMade famous by the spine-chilling graphic novel and movie V For Vendetta and its subsequent use by protest and activist groups worldwide, the iconic Guy Fawkes mask’s forerunner was created shortly after its namesake’s execution, following the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605. Every November 5—the anniversary of the failed rebellion—people in Britain held a “Guy Fawkes Night,” in which they burned an effigy wearing a likeness of the man’s face.\nLater on, people actually wore Guy Fawkes masks in the 18th century. During that time, little children wore crude versions of the mask while begging on the streets. Some would even go further and completely dress themselves for the occasion by blackening their faces and wearing old, black clothing. To complete the look, they would also repeatedly recite the famous “Remember the fifth of November” chant out on the street.\nThe lack of an Internet connection did not impede 19th-century rabid fanboys and fangirls from fixating on their idol, which at the time happened to be Sherlock Holmes. A devoted following of the famous detective during the Victorian era spearheaded the beginning of modern fandom.\nThese fans acted every bit as obsessive as their modern counterparts. So when author Conan Doyle—who didn’t care much for Holmes—killed off the detective in his fight with Professor Moriarty, fans were outraged. Many protested the death by walking on the streets wearing black armbands. One woman even allegedly hit Doyle with an umbrella.\nThe protests reached as far as America, where fans petitioned Doyle “to keep Holmes alive.” An exasperated Doyle had to relent and write a new story saying that Holmes did survive the confrontation, to the joyous glee of fans everywhere.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

There were periods that were harder, as with all households, but mostly we were comfortable. We didn’t go on holidays or do many extravagant things, but we had a huge house with an even bigger garden.\nThen I got to university, and I spent a couple of years very manic. Those years completely obliterated me financially. I defaulted on several bank accounts and credit cards, after chewing through the entirety of my student loans by drinking too much and eating a frankly obscene amount of curly fries from the university bar.\nThe years after that, I tried to stay living in the same city, but the finality of my mental breakdown meant that I was living on benefits. And I was appealing those benefits, so I was on the minimum amount you can get paid whilst waiting for a result.\nI learned different lessons about money in those years; how to make a meal that cost 50 pence. How to feel guilty about every single purchase. Most of all, how to struggle with accepting help.\nYou see, I don’t talk about money.\nIt’s what we did growing up, and it’s what I continued to do in adulthood, even in the years where I was obliterating my credit. The first time I had to talk about it was when I was defaulting, and even then I talked only to my mum and my financial advisor – no one else. My mum made all of the phone calls for me, because I couldn’t do it myself.\nAnd I kept on that way, not talking about it, going quiet whenever any of my friends – who were all working in ‘real jobs’, earning money in amounts that I could barely imagine – would mention money. It’s worth noting that to me, an amount that I could barely imagine? Was minimum wage. The idea of earning that much overwhelmed me.\nBut in those years, I also had to learn to handle money properly again. Because I wasn’t allowed an overdraft or a credit card anymore, and so the benefits I got were all that I had. And I did learn, quickly and well, getting to a point where I could live acceptably within my means most of the time. If I wanted or needed something bigger, I’d find a way to earn cash for it, through housesitting or similar.\nBut I still wasn’t actually talking about it.\nI’m far from the only person who does this, I know that. I’m sure many people have to work through a childhood of never talking about money and turn that into a functional adulthood. That’s partly why I’m writing this – to call out to those of you who have had this same experience and say ‘hey, me too!’.\nSo fast forward a few years. I’m okayish with money now, though it still terrifies me, and I can’t spend more than £10 on basically anything without wanting to vomit. My partner and I are living together, actually in our own place rather than with family. For two years, we live together without talking about money much at all.\nWe do sometimes, when it’s absolutely necessary. But mostly, I pay for the food out of my benefits, and he pays for all the other things. The things I don’t want to see, because the numbers are too scary – like the rent. I have a vague notion of how much this is, and the council tax, and the energy bills, and so forth. But he valiantly protects me from the numbers that terrify me.\nBecause we’re actually pretty comfortable now. We can have meals that cost more than 50 pence a portion. We can afford to go to places, and eat out, and do other things that make me horrified. (You want to get takeaway? ONE TAKEAWAY COSTS AS MUCH AS OUR ENTIRE WEEKLY FOOD BUDGET!).\nOnly I can’t, because I’m too afraid of the numbers involved. Every time my meagre income doesn’t cover things, I have to ask him to send me money. Every time I have to do that, I agonise over it for hours and often have panic attacks. It’s my fault. I’m terrible with money.\nSo another couple of years onwards, we now own a house. We have a car, we have expensive computers that we took out on a loan, and I’m still sitting here with my £350/month benefits income paying for the food shopping and a few bills and not much else. When we need to make a bigger purchase (one over £10), I literally walk away from the checkout and leave my partner paying so I don’t hear the total. Sometimes I don’t walk away fast enough, and I feel sick for the rest of the day.\nBut we have to make decisions as a couple about things we want to do or not do. My non-involvement…isn’t really tenable. So this past weekend, I faced the thing that has terrified me in the background, constantly, for years. I looked at our budget. At the giant numbers – the budget has our mortgage in (not a small number), our car loan (also not small), our computers (of which mine was a gift so I never knew how much it cost before).\nI spent an hour crying whilst learning to understand the budget.\nMy partner, patient as ever, held my hand and took me through how it all works. He – now we – uses You Need a Budget, which I would definitely recommend because its UI is lovely. I just wouldn’t recommend connecting it to accounts (which you can’t do outside the US anyway), because it’s not incredibly secure.\nAll of it makes sense, and I can see how it’s going to help me better imagine our money. How it could help me learn that spending money is not evil, and that we are in fact in a very comfortable and privileged place, even having only one proper income. I just have to stop thinking of our income as my paltry sum, and instead as what we earn together. So nothing big, right?\nAn hour later we’ve gone through it all, and I feel like I’ve run a marathon, but I’ve done it. There’s nothing else to do until the next time I spend or earn money, so I close it and put it aside until payday, the next financial event.\nThen the next day, I have a panic attack.\nIt’s not a bad one. As I’ve gotten better at identifying and dealing with panic attacks, they’ve gotten a lot less explosive. I have quiet panic attacks now, the kind you can have without bothering anyone else. Without anyone else noticing. The awfulness inherent in that is a whole other post worth of stuff, but for now let’s just say that I had such a panic attack.\nI couldn’t work out why, though. I had been talking about how we needed to buy new bins for the kitchen, and how I could move money around to do it. But a panic attack based on that seemed out of the blue even for me. Then I remembered the budget, and the numbers, and suddenly it all made sense.\nBecause when you’re facing as pervasive and overwhelming a fear as this, it isn’t just scary in the moment. It’s scary theoretically in the space around those moments. And I know that in order to get rid of the stress that finances cause me, I’ve got to face down a lot more stress first.\nBut I’ve started – and that’s the most important thing.\nThank you so much for reading!

It was originally built in 1791 by Richard Phillips.\nIt is a two-storey castellated mansion, built of randomly laid local sandstone with Forest of Dean stone dressings situated on the outskirts of Swansea.\nThe Castle with its many annexes has a complex roof structure made from slate. These annex roof structures drain into the interconnected valley drainage system formed from lead sheeting.\nThe failure of the valley drainage system has resulted in a prolonged exposure of parts of the roof structure to sustained water ingress leading to wet rot in the underlying span beams, hip rafters and ceiling joists. The suspended ornate lath and plaster ceiling has suffered localised damage but is a period feature that must be retained.\nProtectahome, approved Rotafix contractors, were subcontracted by RM Williams to undertake the specialist repairs required to restore this beautiful building to its original glory with minimal disruption to the integrity of the existing building features.\nProtectahome, in conjunction with Rotafix and Ian Jones Associates, Structural Engineering Consultants, developed a series of low disturbance repairs to the roof timber members using Rotafix Structural Adhesive, (RSA), Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) rods, and KERTO structural engineered timber sections to replace in situ the timbers that had been ravaged by the ingress of moisture over time.\nThe hip beams supporting the roof were badly damaged at the wall plate and bearing ends. Once the structure was supported it was possible to remove the damaged and decayed timber.\nMeasurements were then taken and an oversize KERTO replacement prepared off site. The Rotafix Timber Resin Splice (TRS) side slot design was chosen as the preferred method of joining the original and replacement timbers as access was limited.\nStructural calculations showed that 6 number 16 mm diameter high tensile rebar connections would be required to meet the requirements of the design.\nOnce the Rotafix TRS section was on site the experienced craftsmen of Protectahome cut and fitted the new timber to the exact requirements. The slots in the KERTO and existing parent timber were then injection filled with the RSA.\nThe span beams were repaired by removing the damaged timber. Holes were then drilled up into the ends of the parent timbers to allow high tensile strength 20mm rebar rods to be bonded in place. New sections of KERTO were made to measure that featured 6 side slots to receive the protruding 20mm diameter rods. The slots in the timber were filled with RSA. KERTO engineered timber was used to give guaranteed strength consistency to the joist repair.\nBonded in rods were also used to repair joists in the ceiling. In this instance it was possible to achieve the design specification using 12mm GFRP rods and replacement grade C24 softwood timber .\nOnce the ceiling joists had been repaired the lath and plaster restoration work commenced in the knowledge that the roof structure was rigid and sound.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}
{"best_of": 1, "echo": true, "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 0, "model": "opt-1.5b", "n": 1, "prompt": "Surely one of the greatest concerns of the papacy of Benedict XVI was his ongoing attempt to overcome the dualism between faith and reason—and hence, between faith and life—that dominates Western culture at present, even among those of us who are Christian. Dualism inclines us to think that faith is something that belongs to the realm of the things we \"do,\" perhaps with our activities on a Sunday or in carving out a portion of our day for Christ, as though He were something we make happen, as though He didn't have everything to do with life, as though He were not \"all, and in all\" [Col. 3:11].\nIn his encyclical letters on love and hope, and in the key addresses he gave, including ones at Regensburg, La Sapienza and the Bundestag, Benedict everywhere insisted that the greatest challenge facing the Church today is her need to overcome this dualism at the heart of modernity and \"to devise effective ways of proclaiming to contemporary culture the 'realism' of her faith in the saving work of Christ.\"\nNow the encyclical on faith, Lumen Fidei, itself effectively proclaims \"the realism of faith\" and sheds light on why we may well indeed see the fruitful proclamation of this truth as the Church's greatest challenge at this historical juncture. Lumen Fidei is, in many respects, a masterful consummation of Benedict's thinking on this question; and, though Benedict and Francis may well have made distinctive contributions to the encyclical, they are clearly united in their desire to convey, above all, the preeminent Christian truth that the Logos is the self-communication of God's Presence in all of reality—a Presence that can be truly known and verified in experience, in our \"concrete life-stories,\" as Francis calls them in Lumen Fidei.\n\"Our culture has lost its sense of God's tangible presence and activity in our world. We think that God is to be found in the beyond, on another level of reality, far removed from our everyday relationships. But if this were the case, if God could not act in the world, His love would not be truly powerful, truly real, and thus not even true, a love capable of delivering the bliss that it promises. It would make no difference at all whether we believed in Him or not.\"\nHow did this situation come to pass where the tangible presence of God has become increasingly lost in our culture and where \"visible and material realities are\" no longer \"seen to point beyond themselves to the mystery of the eternal\"? This is no mere academic question, for when God becomes so far removed from reality that we think of ourselves as incapable of knowing Him in any way through what is real, faith is thereby considered to be irrelevant to life's needs, and we soon have no need of faith. The evidence of this is everywhere around us, so much so that today even a great many Christians live what is in effect a practical atheism.\nA significant contributing factor to this state of affairs was the self-limitation of reason imposed by modernity, a limitation that was radicalized by the impact of the natural sciences and that reduces the real to only what can be empirically verified or deduced mathematically. It doesn't strain credulity too much to see how this reduced understanding of reason has as a consequence a steady refusal of belief in God. In comparison with what is empirically verifiable, the question of God seems unreal, and can be readily dispensed with as we go about our affairs in the world.\nOr, as an alternative response to reason's seeming incapacity, faith becomes for many Christians, as Francis points out in Lumen Fidei, with a nod to Kierkegaard and his ilk, an irrational \"leap\" into the darkness, a work of the individual subject that can have no claims on our life in common.\nThere are serious consequences to the position that relegates faith to the realm of the irrational, and we are already seeing the loss of confidence in truth and the extreme skepticism that inevitably follows, as Francis notes in his first encyclical.\n\"We are willing to allow for subjective truths of the individual, which consist in fidelity to his or her deepest convictions, yet these are truths valid only for that individual and not capable of being proposed to others in an effort to serve the common good.\"\nTo respond to this challenge, Lumen Fidei invites us, as Benedict did at Regensburg, to once again \"broaden reason\" and to resist the reduction of reason imposed by modernity. The broadening of reason is imperative, we discover, because any attempt to reduce reason's scope necessarily results in the attenuation of faith.\nBut what does it mean, precisely, to broaden reason?\nIt perhaps comes as no surprise that the current pope and his predecessor should call for a broadening of reason. After all, the Catholic tradition's defence of the idea that \"grace perfects nature and reason, it does not destroy them\" is there in seminal form in the earliest Christian generations and down through the centuries. Tertullian's famous quip, \"What indeed has Athens to do with Jerusalem?... Away with all attempts to produce a mottled Christianity of Stoic, Platonic and dialectic composition! With our faith, we desire no further belief,\" was never more than an extreme minority position. The Fathers of the Church and theologians of the Middle Ages, in their consideration of the manner in which natural theology ought to be understood in relation to Biblical revelation, or in which human philosophizing ought to be understood in relation to religious belief, definitively rejected the dualism implied in Tertullian's view and defended the idea that Athens had everything to do with Jerusalem. In fact, providence had so ordained history that Athens and Jerusalem—and Rome as well—had prepared the way for the birth of Christianity (cf. Augustine's City of God). Saint Clement of Alexandria even went so far as to argue that Greek philosophy had been given to humankind as a second source of Divine truth, akin to Holy Writ itself. Echoing these voices in the Tradition, Benedict stated at Regensburg, \"The encounter between the Biblical message and Greek thought did not happen by chance.\"\nHowever, debates concerning the Hellenization of Christianity that occupied the earliest Christian generations, or the program of de-Hellenization that has marked the landscape of modernity, are not Lumen Fidei's principal concern (although the document does remark on the contribution the Greek metaphysical heritage made to the Christian faith). More fundamentally, the encyclical, in calling us to broaden reason, proposes that faith itself is a form of knowledge of reality that best coincides with our rational nature—a kind of knowledge that gives us \"new eyes to see\" more truly the meaning of things.\nTo further understand the significance of this point about faith, it is worth referring to the well-known chapter and verse from the Letter to the Hebrews that provides something of a definition of faith. Interestingly, while Lumen Fidei refers a number of times to the Letter, it nowhere refers to Heb. 11:1. Benedict's discussion of the Letter in Spe Salvi, however, provides an important background to the discussion of the nature of faith in the current document. In Spe Salvi, Benedict examines the exegetical controversy that arose in the wake of the Reformation concerning the definition of faith given in the 11th chapter of the Letter. The relevant verse is: \"Faith is the hypostasis of things hoped for; the proof of things not seen.\" The Fathers of the Church and theologians of the Middle Ages consistently rendered the Greek word hypostasis in Latin as the term substantia, so that the verse reads, \"Faith is the 'substance' of things hoped for; the proof of things not seen.\" Luther departed from this reading when he took hypostasis (substance) not in the objective sense of a reality present within us, but in the subjective sense, as an expression of an interior attitude and disposition of the subject. On his reading, the rendering of the passage becomes \"Faith is standing firm in what one hopes, being convinced of what one does not see.\" But as Benedict remarked in Spe Salvi that the Greek term elenchos \"does not have the subjective sense of 'conviction' but the objective sense of 'proof.'\"… And the concept of \"substance\" implies that through faith—albeit in a tentative way—\"there are already present in us [and in what is real] the things that are hoped for.\"\n\"Faith is not merely a personal reaching out towards things to come that are still totally absent: it gives us something. It gives us even now something of the reality we are waiting for, and this present reality constitutes for us a 'proof' of the things that are still unseen.\"\n\"…when the why of things is explored in full harmony with the search for the ultimate answer, then human reason reaches its zenith and opens to the religious impulse [that represents] the highest expression of the human person, because it is the highpoint of his rational nature.\"\nWhen reason expresses itself as openness to Being, then religiosity is the discovery made in that openness. Looking at our experience with integrity, we discover that every thing in reality, every event, solicits us, and is an invitation to, or a sign of, something more. We discover that we are made for the Infinite, that we have, to paraphrase Saint Augustine, been made for God and have a heart that is restlessly seeking Him. It is a persistent factor of our experience to intuit in reality this something more; not to admit it—to deny the evidence of our lived experience—is therefore unreasonable.\nFor Lumen Fidei, recognition of this apex, this docta ignorantia, or \"known unknown,\" is what is most adequate to reason. Contrarily, a reason that rests at the appearance of things, with its own analyses and interpretations, refuses the initiative that the Mystery, which is God, takes in history, and in the story of each of our lives, inscribed as He is in our hearts.\nBut, of course, it is one thing to claim that humans are naturally religious, and quite another to suggest that faith itself is in any way something we can reach or generate on our own. Structurally we are made for God, and what best coincides with our rational nature is this awareness; but faith is an utterly gratuitous gift of God, which doesn't happen because we speak of Him, discourse about Him. It happens because He makes it happen! \"God cannot be reduced to an object\" of our interpretations and analyses. \"He is a subject who makes himself known and perceived in an interpersonal relationship,\" Francis writes in Lumen Fidei. \"Faith is born of an encounter which takes place in history and lights up our journey through time.\"\nAgainst all forms of Gnosticism that begin with the human rather than the Divine initiative, Lumen Fidei everywhere insists that \"rather than ourselves possessing truth, it is truth that embraces and possesses us.\"\nSo how do we bridge the gap, then, between the seemingly disparate ideas that faith is a gratuitous gift of God, that He takes the initiative to enable us to know Him, and by the same token to suggest that we are naturally religious (i.e. made for God), that \"God is light and He can be found also by those who seek Him with a sincere heart,\" as Francis writes? For if God's gift is utterly gratuitous, it would seem that it matters little whether or not our nature is hard-wired for Him or our heart restlessly seeks Him.\nThe resolution of this seeming contradiction is simple: precisely because our heart is made for God, when He comes to meet us, we know that He is what we have been truly looking for. He is what truly corresponds to the deepest needs of our heart, according to Luigi Giussani in The Religious Sense. It remains for our freedom to respond to the Divine initiative or—dramatically—to refuse it.\n\"It is through an unbroken chain of witnesses that we come to see the face of Jesus. But how is this possible? How can we be certain, after all these centuries, that we have encountered the 'real Jesus'? Were we merely isolated individuals, were our starting point simply our own individual ego seeking in itself the basis of absolutely sure knowledge, a certainty of this sort would be impossible. I cannot possibly verify for myself something that happened so long ago. But this is not the only way we attain knowledge. Persons always live in relationship. We come from others, we belong to others, and our lives are enlarged by our encounter with others. Even our own knowledge and self-awareness are relational; they are linked to others who have gone before us: in the first place, our parents, who gave us our life and our name….\"\nAnd so, \"the individual's act of faith finds its place within a community, within the common 'we' of the people who, in faith, are like a single person—'my first-born son,' as God would describe all of Israel [cf. Ex. 4:22]. Here mediation is not an obstacle, but an opening: Through our encounter with others, our gaze rises to a truth greater than ourselves.\"\nJust as faith is a gratuitous gift that best corresponds to our rational nature, and hence fulfills rather than bypasses our humanity, similarly, faith in Christ comes through what is real—namely, a concrete companionship of people who comprise the Church for us and who help our faith become a knowledge that is certain.\nThere is much more that could be said about this extraordinary document. What is most striking, perhaps, is that, in inviting us to recover a sacramental view of reality, Lumen Fidei provides us with an orientation towards existence that is our best hope for overcoming the dualism between faith and life that characterizes our world.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

My team and I have been busy in recent months, and I wanted to bring you up to date on some of our work. This Monday, I gave my first State of the City address at the Berkeley Rep, with more than 400 people in attendance. In case you missed it, you can watch the speech here.\nHomelessness is a complex problem, but I am proud that our city is tackling it in decisive ways. Starting last month, our new Homeless Outreach and Treatment Team (HOTT), made up of five Berkeley mental health staff, including a public health nurse, hit the streets of Berkeley and Albany. The HOTT team was one of the many recommendations from the Homeless Task Force we convened when I served as a City Councilmember.\nThese outreach workers will meet people wherever they are -- parks, shelters, encampments, and sidewalks -- to develop trust and help them access the services they need. The focus is on the long-term homeless who suffer from disabilities, specifically mental health. With HOTT, our goal is to disrupt the destructive cycle of hospitalization, incarceration, and homelessness that is all too common for those with serious mental illness.\nThe outreach team will work in partnership with The Hub, Berkeley’s single point of entry for city funded housing and homeless services to identify clients and link them to services. If you know someone who needs help, please call The Hub at 1-866-960-2132.\nWhile the HOTT team will travel throughout the two cities, UC Berkeley has also hired an outreach worker who will be permanently assigned to People’s Park, who will work closely with the city. New UC Chancellor Carol Christ is committed to working with the City to address the issue of homelessness and housing. Our hope is that this investment will encourage more people to access services and get the treatment they need. At the same time, city staff are working on a Resource Guide for the Homeless that will help people navigate the city’s complex network of services. We plan to distribute this guide to police, downtown ambassadors, residents and business owners to empower them to help people. I believe that in conjunction with trained outreach workers, we can make a difference and reduce the number of people who live on the street.\nTwo weeks ago the City Council approved our $400 million budget, along with my budget recommendations that include $650,000 in anti-displacement initiatives, like eviction defense and emergency rental assistance. This is the largest investment Berkeley has ever made towards anti-displacement programs. The budget also includes a $400,000 commitment toward the Pathways Project, a comprehensive plan that would build a shelter where the homeless can bring their significant others, their pets and their belongings. Modeled on a tremendously successful navigation center in San Francisco, the shelter will offer on-site services to address immediate housing needs, and give people experiencing homelessness the dignity they deserve. The second piece of Pathways is the creation of a tiny home village for longer term stays that would be located in a non-residential area.\nI’m excited to report that the new budget makes the biggest investment in the arts by increasing the Civic Arts Grants program by $140,000. The budget also allows us to create six new firefighter/paramedic positions, enough to staff a fourth local ambulance. And starting this fiscal year, we will finally have funding for body cameras for every Berkeley Police Department officer, which will help keep the police accountable while rebuilding trust among residents. These are small, yet vital changes. Lastly, the budget includes the largest General Fund reserve in city history, putting our city in its strongest fiscal footing in decades.\nWith the new federal administration, there is understandable concern over the militarization of our local police and our cooperation with federal agencies. Throughout the country, we have seen police respond to protests or serving search warrants in an aggressive way. As a result, there is a great deal of fear and mistrust between police and communities of color.\nGiven the hyper-militarized training Urban Shield provides, I believe we need to find a way to end Berkeley’s participation. But I also don’t think that we can do it overnight. I am committed to studying alternative ways we can ensure that our first responders are trained for not just shootings, but for major disasters such as a large earthquake, which we know can happen at any time. The subcommittee I am creating will immediately begin studying alternatives to the program that ensure the safety of our community. My goal is that in six months’ time, we will move towards leaving Urban Shield permanently.\nI also want to address the protest that erupted as we were voting on the item. Some of the council members felt intimidated and scared and chose to leave. Finally, we are still waiting to hear from the police about their version of the events and why force was needed to disperse protesters who were crowding their car. These situations are never clear cut and I look forward to learning more about what happened.\nOn June 13, the Council unanimously approved prioritizing the Berkeley Way project, which if approved, would be the largest supportive housing development for the homeless the city has ever built. The proposed project would be located at Berkeley Way and Henry Street and include 89 affordable apartments, 53 studios of permanent supportive housing, 32 shelter beds, 12 transitional units for veterans, and a first-floor services center with a community kitchen. This exciting development is being spearheaded by the Berkeley Food & Housing Project (BFHP) and Bridge Housing, organization with years of experience in building affordable housing. City planners are working to submit project plans to the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program, casually known as “cap and trade” to receive upwards of $17 million toward Berkeley Way. The deadline is this fall.\nMy office is part of a regional task force that is studying how we can keep Alta Bates, our beloved community hospital slated to close by 2030, open. One possibility is a bill by Senator Nancy Skinner that would give the California Attorney General the authority to review the impact of a potential hospital closure before moving forward. Senate Bill 687 would also require at least one public hearing before the hospital is closed. The bill passed the Senate on May 31 and was referred to the Assembly Committee on Health. Since then, it has been referred to the Judiciary Committee, with a hearing date of July 11. Under current law, California hospitals are only required to give a 90-day notice to the Department of Public Health prior to shutting down operations.\nIn June, my office, along with Councilmembers Ben Bartlett, Cheryl Davila and Kate Harrison, worked to make changes to the City of Berkeley’s Housing Retention Program. Formerly, the program was only able to help Berkeley tenants facing eviction from permanent housing. We authored an item that expands the scope to include all income eligible Berkeley tenants facing housing emergencies, including supporting security deposits for families securing permanent housing, or providing assistance for families who need temporary housing after eviction.\nWith the change, maximum assistance to help families facing a housing emergency was increased from $3,000 to $5,000. It also clarified eligibility by allowing all tenant families who are at or below 80 percent of Area Median Income to be eligible for the fund.\nThe FY 2018/2019 budget increased the Housing Retention Program to $250,000. With these new funds we can help the broadest number of people stay housed.\nCalifornia Senate Bill 649, a bill that would allow telecommunications companies to place powerful antennas near people’s homes without input from residents or local governments, will soon be heard before the Assembly Committee on Communications and Conveyance. This April, city council voiced opposition to the bill on account of potential aesthetic and environmental harms associated with placing antennas in residential neighborhoods. Berkeley is part of a growing network of cities supporting residents by condemning SB 649.\nSaturday, July 15 9 a.m.-1 p.m.\nOn Saturday, July 15, the Shorebird Park Nature Center is organizing a shoreline clean-up to help remove trash and plastics from our bay.

{"best_of": 1, "echo": true, "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 0, "model": "opt-1.5b", "n": 1, "prompt": "“In my last [letter] I left off at our sitting down to Supper on our Wedding Night, where I behaved with as much Bashfulness as the purest Virgin in the World could have done. The most difficult Task for me was to blush; however, by holding my Breath, and squeezing my Cheeks with my Handkerchief, I did pretty well” (297).\nReading Samuel Richardson’s novel Pamela, Or, Virtue Rewarded, as I recounted in my previous review of it, is not for the faint of heart; but I am happy to say that it was all made worthwhile just this past week as I listened to a Naxos AudioBooks recording of Henry Fielding’s masterful parody fittingly entitled Shamela. Many know Fielding for Tom Jones, but his satirical powers are at full and outrageous height in Shamela. In a quarter of the number of pages found in the original story, Fielding highlights and lampoons all of Richardson’s characteristic tropes, transforming Miss Pamela Andrews from a paragon of female virtue into an archetypical scheming hussy. The great irony is that, as shamefully vicious as Shamela maybe, she is a great deal more fun to listen to than her saintly prototype.\nCentral to Richardson’s sentimental plot was Pamela’s virtue. By virtue, readers must understand two things: her honesty and her virginity. Understandably, Pamela insists on protecting these, since they are her only means for attracting a worthy and, hopefully, wealthy suitor. Because these two meanings of virtue are at the heart of the conflict in Pamela, Fielding places them squarely at the heart of his comedic retelling. Shamela, as her name implies, is anything but honest. In her letters to her mother, she makes it plain that her every action toward Squire Booby (Mr. B’s new name) is aimed at provoking the young man’s sexual passion as a means to coerce him into marriage. Accordingly, her protestations against that gentleman’s sexual advances, while they mirror Pamela’s, are all pretense. She would like nothing better than for her employer to seduce her, but not before she secures a share of his fortune for herself. As she tells Mrs. Jervis: “…Fellows have often taken away in the Morning, what they gave over Night. No, Mrs. Jervis, nothing under a regular taking into Keeping, a settled Settlement, for me, and all my Heirs, all my whole Liftetime, shall do the Business–or else crosslegged, is the Word…” (283). Of course, as the quote with which I opened this review indicates, Shamela is no virgin anyway!\nAs you might have guessed, Pamela is not the only character whose personality Fielding changes for comedic effect–all the major characters are the opposite of their originals. Mr. B is a fool, Mr. Williams is a lascivious skamp, Mrs. Jervis is a coconspirator, and, best of all, Pamela’s parents are low-class trash. Indeed, while the original Pamela’s father writes ad nauseum to his daughter about her Christian duty, Shamela’s father is serving time in prison. And Shamela’s mother is little better. Readers are told she “sold Oranges in the Play-House,” a not so subtle way to say she was a prostitute (280).\nIn fact, Shamela’s mother–whose regal name, Henrietta Maria Honora Andrews, belies her tawdry lifestyle–steals this story’s spotlight, for it was her corrupting influence that produced Shamela. As a result, Shamela repeatedly articulates pithy proverbs of vice in her letters to her mother, as if to illustrate just how well she has been schooled. For example, she writes, “What a foolish Thing it is for a Woman to dally too long with her Lover’s Desires; how many have owed their being old Maids to their holding out too long” (294). When things go sour between mother and daughter, however, the result is a venomous act of retaliation on the part of Mrs. Andrews: the publication of her daughter’s letters–an act to which we owe Fielding’s “corrected” version of events.\nSince Richardson’s Pamela was aimed at didactically preaching the rewards of virtue, then Fielding’s parody presumes to take the same stance, mocking the original Pamela for its sexual lewdness, its rather scathing portrayal of the vices of the upper class, and its encouragement of disobedience in servants (279). Ironically, however, the two authors actually manage to achieve the same end–the condemnation of hypocrisy–just through very different means: Richardson through sentimentalism, Fielding through satire. Fortunately, Jane Austen was a fan of both authors, and she perfectly combines and tempers, sentimentalism and satire in her novels by adding a healthy portion of realism. True, her early short works like “Love and Freindship” and “Lesley Castle” lean more toward the absurdities of Fielding, but by Lady Susan, she has already learned to soften her satire with realism, making it clear she supports virtue and condemns vice, but not at the cost of her sense of humor. She, like Fielding, enjoys a good laugh at the follies of others, but that is because she doesn’t like to take herself or others too seriously. After all, the ability to laugh was just as important to the Austen family as the ability to pray.\nThat said, I highly recommend the audio recording of this hilarious work, which I award five bright stars. After listening to Pamela, you will laugh out loud when you hear the same voices transform their accents, grammar, and diction, bringing to life the scandalous characters and conflicts that make Shamela an impressive example of parodic humor.\nFielding was not creating Shamela out of thin air, he was making explicit what was ALREADY implicit in Pamela–i.e., Richardson deliberately wrote Pamela to be read straight by trusting readers, and to be read as Shamela by readers who realized it was also possiible to read Pamela AGAINST the grain–or in my terminology, Fielding made explicit the shadow story of Richardson’s novel.\nJane Austen emulated Richardson’s Pamela and Fielding’s Shamela in the character of Harriet Smith in Emma. I.e., Harriet can be read straight as the naive simpleton whom Emma adopts as a human pet, or she can be read as a clever scheming manipulator who plays Emma like a violin with a FAKE dumb blonde act.\nArnie, your first point is well taken. I certainly think part of Fielding’s genius is exposing the two ways of reading Pamela.\nAs for the second point, I would have to think about that. On the one hand, I think Pamela is much more intelligent than Harriet Smith, even if she’s naive in some ways. She’s always much more proactive (to the extent that she may act) than Harriet–but, then, she’s a protagonist, whereas Harriet isn’t. On the other hand, I’m not sure I could buy the idea that Harriet is manipulating Emma. I don’t see textual support for that, though it’s a fun theory. That said, I’m about to reread Emma for my Austen class at DePaul. I’ll try to keep an eye out for Austen’s treatment of Harriet. The biggest problem with this theory, for me, is the ultimate plot dissimilarities between Pamela and Harriet and Harriet and Shamela–namely, there aren’t men buzzing around Harriet, as with Pamela (only one of the men Harriet claims to love actually has romantic interest in her). And it would be odd to say Harriet manipulates men as Shamela does, only to end up with Robert Martin. Having just read Pamela and Shamela, I’ll be open to looking for the similarities you point out.\nGreat review of what sounds like a first-rate audio execution.\nTry the audio of Pamela Jane. It could ease the overwhelming word count.\nI waded through Samuel Richardson’s Pamela, enjoying it immensely. I tried to get through Fielding’s Joseph Andrews and had to put it down. Shamela looks to be much more to my liking (I’ll probably read rather than listen) and you review is excellent in creating interest.

Many of these were created during last year’s market boom, bringing 167 fresh funds into the fold. This suffusion of new blood added to the 39 funds created from 2011-2016, upping to total to more than 200 active cryptocurrency hedge funds managing an estimated $3.5-5bln in assets.\nBy contrast, only 20 funds have been established in 2018 thus far, putting the industry on track to produce roughly 120 new funds by the end of the year. Given the 9 that have already bitten the dust so far this year, though, the final tally could very well be much less.\nWith to-date returns in 2018 of -23.31%–which is in brutally stark contrast to the 1,708.50% returns these funds averaged in 2017–negative bottom lines and market uncertainty are no doubt driving these closures. This same market uncertainty could leave 10% of these funds kaput by year’s end, according to Autonomous Research LLP’s global director of fintech strategy, Lex Sokolin. Rick Marini, a founding partner of Protocol Ventures, believes that only 50 of the currently active funds will be able to raise enough capital by 2019 to stay afloat.\nMoney Out of Reach or Just Playing Hide and Seek?\nEven as investors shy away from cryptocurrencies and hedge funds close up shop, capital, in some form or another, is still finding its way into the crpytocurrency space. The money’s still there–if you know where to look.\nAnd if you’re a blockchain/crypto entrepreneur, the money is still there if you know who to look to. Returns may be down, but 2018’s venture capital investments, for example, are still on pace to match or surpass last year’s $1bln in funding. So far, venture capital groups have poured over $350mln into projects this year alone.\nOne such project, Blockstream, a blockchain development organization, raised $55mln in its Series A investing round in February of this year, and it’s not alone. In a Series B, Bitpay also attracted 7-figures in funding with a total of $40mln in investment capital.\nOutside of venture capital, 2018 has also seen the largest acquisition of a cryptocurrency company so far in the industry’s young history. In late February, Circle Internet Financial Ltd., a Goldman Sachs-backed company, purchased Poloniex exchange for a whopping $400mln. Since this buyout, other companies have considered following suit, such as Tokyo-based internet broker Monex, which has debated purchasing the Japanese exchange Coincheck.\nHedge funds are taking a hit for now, and given the meteoric rise of these funds at a time when picking a successful investment was as easy as playing blindfold-less pin the tail on the donkey, more will likely drop off as the year progresses. VC investments and multi-million dollar acquisitions like those previously mentioned, though, indicate that, even during the market downturn, institutional money isn’t waiting on the sidelines to get its skin in the game.\nIf hedge funds continue to strike out, big players may step up to bat in other areas of the industry as they look for home run opportunities.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

The reason is that everyone is using social media whether a small or a large business. Therefore if you are thinking of standing out of the competition, you must ensure you do something different from rest. If you are thinking of setting yourself apart from the game, you need to have a website that portrays the nature of your business and gives the right information about your company.\nThere are top benefits of using custom websites. One of them is uniqueness. If you want to have a unique site you have to make sure that you are dealing with someone who understands what your business is all about before developing your web.

Another advantage of using custom-made websites is the fact that it is secure. The importance of security is so high such that you will sometimes get a warning when you are about to enter a website that is on a page that is without SSL installed. It is advisable to ensure that you use a website builder that can eliminate a large volume of risk related to the website.

You can return to most normal activity the very next day. The reading vision begins to improve over the first seven days, but can continue to improve up to six months. Most patients showed and improvement in reading vision anywhere from 3–5 lines on the vision chart. Binocular distance vision was not significantly impacted but the Raindrop eye showed half a line of distance vision decrease.\nIf you have cataracts, and don’t want to wear thick reading glasses, then there is the new Symfony® extended range intraocular lens implant that allows good vision for driving, computer range and reading. This implant has become extremely popular over the past two years for people who want to minimize reliance on glasses for distance and near activity after cataract surgery. It also treats astigmatism, unlike the older multifocal cataract implants. People report far less night glare and halo and improved intermediate and computer vision, making it ideal for people in their fifties, sixties and seventies who like to use the computer for work or for fun.\nEven in the field of LASIK, there are new lasers that make super fine flaps, thus allowing safe LASIK in thinner corneas and new wavefront technology to allow more precise and micro pinpoint treatment to reduce symptoms such as halo, glare and astigmatism.\nLastly, in the under 40 population, with a prescription too high for LASIK, we have new implantable contact lens (ICL) technology that allows for treatment of nearsightedness and astigmatism as well.\nAll of these exciting new technologies can lead to significant reduction dependence on glasses.

If you're not familiar with ID cards, you may think a slot refers to a randomly placed slit in a card, which wouldn't make much sense.\nInstead, a slotted ID card is an ID card that has a small, oval-shaped notch taken out of the card material. A slot is used to make it easy to attach the card to an accessory like a lanyard, badge reel or strap clip.\nSlots are put into card using a slot punch, which is similar to the handheld hole punches you probably used in elementary school art class.\nSlots can be put on both the horizontal and vertical edge of an ID card.\nWhy use a slotted ID card?\nPeople aren't punching slots in their shiny, new ID cards for no reason — they're useful!\nThe most obvious advantage offered by a slotted ID card is that it's easier to carry and display.\nHaving a slot on your ID allows it to be easily paired with a strap clip, lanyard or badge reel. These accessories can just slide through the slot for an easy, secure solution.\nUnslotted ID cards, on the other hand, are harder to display.\nThere are accessories like card clamps that can hold an ID card without needing a slot, but they aren't as secure as a clip through a slot.\nIn fact, if a card is designed to be worn or displayed and isn't slotted, it's usually paired with a slotted badge holder to make things easier.\nDo I need to put a slot in my ID card?\nThere can be arguments made for both sides, but it really comes down your unique situation.

It will make it easier to find the perfect accessory for wearing the card.\nIf your answer is NO, you don't need to worry about slotting your cards. If a card is going to be kept in a wallet or pocket, there's no sense in putting in a slot.\nDoes your card contain internal technology?\nIf your answer is YES, you should only slot your ID cards if they have guidelines like the ones to the right. These guidelines (or guide dots, to be more accurate) show the \"safe space\" where a card can be slotted without puncturing the internal wire or chip.\nIf your answer is NO, you're free to slot your ID cards without worry, according to your other needs.\nWhat is your ID card made of?\nIf your ID card is made of PVC, you can slot the card, but do so carefully: putting the slot too close to the edge of the card can lead to easier cracking or splintering.\nIf your card is made of synthetic paper, it will be more resistant to tearing and cracking, leaving you free to put in a slot as necessary — however, you should still avoid putting the slot too close to the edge.\nLooking for new ID cards?

{"best_of": 1, "echo": true, "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 0, "model": "opt-1.5b", "n": 1, "prompt": "The idea was this: for the 1955 Monte Carlo Rally two BMC teams of three team cars would run together, each with a driver and co-driver, and the leading car would carry a third crew member who would be a specialist navigator. This master navigator would devote himself to any major problems that arose during the rally and would work out the course to be followed for all three cars.\nSo I came to be invited to join Reg Holt and Alan Collinson in the team-leading ZA Magnette in the 1955 Monte Carlo Rally. But when the entry list was published, all the teams were broken up. Len Shaw drew number 36, Geoff Holt got 49, and we were far behind at 58. So the master navigator idea was out and each crew had to do its own route finding.\nThat was by no means the only mistake in the project, but there was nobody available to teach us the business of international rallies at that time. In 1954, the newly formed British Motor Corporation decided to enter international rallying. For this new venture both Austin and the Nuffield Group would enter three cars. The two teams were entirely separate, the former operating from Longbridge and the latter from the MG works at Abingdon-on-Thames. The Nuffield Group chose the Magnette - a sporty saloon that proudly carried the motto 'Safety Fast!', an eminently suitable slogan for winning the Monte. If the car seemed an obvious choice, finding the crews was more of a problem.\nIn 1954, there were few factory-entered rally teams but most drivers were already signed up for the Monte. The M.G. factory turned to the M.G. Car Club, and selected three successful drivers from the North-West Centre, all operating around the Manchester area.\nFrequent club events allowed drivers to experience much winter driving over the snowbound Pennines, thereby stimulating the will to win and gaining familiarity with the car. So the teams were chosen and Glasgow was the chosen start point.\nAt the factory the mechanics fitted second spare wheels and two spare tins of petrol in the boot of each car. A set of chains, de-ditching gear and a good box of tools taken together with three people and luggage meant the Magnette was a full one-and-a-half times its design weight. The power of the ZA engine was about 60 bhp which had to move about 30 cwt.\nThe cars reached Manchester from Abingdon the day before we were due to leave for Glasgow. I hurried out to Reg Holt's house to get my first ride in a 'works' car. This journey should have been something like a first flight on a magic carpet. But instead of floating on a magic carpet, the car felt strange, sluggish and awkwardly unmanageable. It was for me the first of many miserable meetings with rally cars where reality had somehow proved a ghastly disappointment after the pleasures of enthusiastic anticipation.\nThe next morning we left for Glasgow, the three maroon MG.s trying to keep in line astern, picking their way over the alternately snow packed and slushy A6. I was wedged in a corner of the back seat, surrounded by piles of auxiliary gear. A rubber pipe theoretically carried some air from the heater to my feet at the back but my feet soon froze in their boots. Just a degree of warmth could be felt by putting the end of the pipe actually into the bottom of a trouser leg.\nThe Trio of Magnettes taken on on the preliminary sortie to the 1955 Monte Carlo Rally. Reg Holt with Collinson and Cave by KJB 910. Photo:- Z Register Archives.\nOn Sunday in Glasgow snow was blowing around and there were reports of snow falling all over Europe. The town was thick with stories of the difficulties crews had experienced trying to get to the start. At the local Nuffield distributors we practised changing wheels and fitting chains to the wheels both on and off the car. The performance was not exactly impressive, but it was good to be doing something constructive. The rally plates and numbers were put on the cars. A second set of chains was added to each boot load.\nThe next day we picked our way through a crowd already hundreds strong to the other 90 cars at the start in Blytheswood Square. Crew members checked and re-checked the bits and pieces. Well-wishers handed us little packets of barley sugar as the cars edged up to the start. At the Royal Scottish Automobile Club A K Stevenson waved the St Andrew's flag for us to go. Mounted policemen nudged a way between the onlookers and soon we were swallowed up in the dark busy streets.\nOnce out of Glasgow hard snow presented a rutted icy surface, but clear patches made it useless to put on our chains. Reg was finding it difficult to control the heavy ungainly MG at more than 30 mph and we were slowly slipping back behind the set average. Several people were coming by us going rather well. I crouched in the back trying to keep my feet from freezing, and trying not to notice how badly we were doing. On the other hand, we did pass a Sunbeam, well off the road and rather bashed.\nWe eventually reached the passage control at Stranraer. We were three-quarters of an hour behind schedule. However, it is a long way to Doncaster where the first time control was situated and we began to make up time along the Solway Firth.\nAs the night wore on the little groups of cheering enthusiasts grew thinner. Many people displayed Good Luck signs, but luck deserted several entries. Peter Bolton and Tommy Sopwith crashed into a telegraph pole outside Stamford and the straggle of cars that reached London before daybreak was half-a-dozen short.\nIt was a fine sunny morning as we reached Dover. With 18 hours and some 900 kms behind them, the cars were gratefully parked aboard the Channel ferry. The drivers dropped quickly on to the nearest bunks and fell asleep to the steady throb of the ship's engines and the gentle rise and fall of the Channel swell.\nIn Boulogne there was an hour to wait at the Gare Maritime, where the Mayor laid on a champagne reception. Both Ian Mackenzie and I were on the next shift to sleep, so we took full advantage of the hospitality, while the duty men sorrowfully had to decline. As soon as the gendarmes' whistles blew to set us on our way I was soundly asleep, oblivious to the rumble of the pave and the occasional frozen patch on the road.\nTwo hours later, the last of the evening light now gone, we checked in at the Lille passage control. At the Belgian frontier, I took over in the driving seat and headed for Brussels. The local M.G. Car Club people were waiting for us on the outskirts and their pilot car led us straight across to the Liège road.\nThroughout this second night we completed the loop of the Low Countries. North first to cross the Rhine by the Nijmegen bridge and thus to Arnhem, and on to a stretch of Dutch motorway - the first time I had ever been on a motorway. At Amsterdam the car was rapidly greased and serviced by the Van den Mark garage, the Nuffield distributors for the Netherlands.\nIt dawned fine again as we crossed back into Belgium, and there was time for a breakfast snack at the Brussels control before we set off for Reims. The roads were clear, the going good. We arrived in the champagne capital with an hour to spare, which gave the Magnette crews time to lunch together and the off-duty men to succumb once again to free champagne. As we took our leave for Paris, the first of the Monte Carlo and Lisbon starters were approaching the town. The vast rally convoy now took almost five hours to pass.\nWe romped into Paris to a great blaring of horns and blowing of whistles. The traffic drove as if everyone was not just in a rally, but a road race. Our poor Magnette could scarcely keep up. The Arc de Triomphe loomed ahead and welcoming officials parked us in the Place de l'Etoile, where a notice board declared floods ahead and trouble in store. The road to Troyes was blocked and traffic at a standstill. Everybody was consulting anxiously the next maps. Local experts were everywhere, offering free advice in broken English. I realised that the moment for the master navigator was at hand.\n\"Inondations! Attention!\" screamed the yellow notice on the road to Troyes, which went straight on between the long lines of trees outlined in the headlamps. We exchanged anxious glances. At least we had built up a little time in hand. Dimly through the side windows I saw reflections of ominous sheets of water on either side. Soon water appeared on the edges of the road and I marked the next available turning. But as we reached it a car came towards us - it could mean the road was passable. We carried straight on. The lapping waters closed and met, but the depth was only an inch or two, and soon the water fell away again. Three times this happened, three times we got safely through, and three times my luck held.\nI was rewarded with a couple of hours in the driving seat as we finally turned due south and headed for the Mediterranean. Our car had given no new trouble, we were without penalty and there were only another twelve hours to go, but the mountains were ahead and we were tired. I drove until Bourg, where we changed round and I had another hour of sleep.\nWhen I woke we were coming to another point of decision. There were three possible routes to Chambery - the more direct they were, the more tricky they looked. We took the shortest, twisting now into the foothills of the Alps; the road clear but icy, narrow and slow. Presently the car was skidding wildly, beyond all reason. We stopped and found the left back tyre was flat. Three stiff and weary men struggled in the cold darkness to make the jack work and fit one of the spares. On our way again at last, the car seemed to handle rather worse, as if it did not like the new tyre tread, and as we laboured slowly up to the tunnel at the top of the Col du Chat all our optimism drained away. But we got down to Chambery on time and the straight main roads welcomed and cheered us again.\nThe tyre marks on the road were more obvious from Chambery onwards for the survivors from Athens to Palermo had now joined in and taken their station at the front of the six-hour long moving queue. Everyone was now on the common route; our own slot was just under an hour from the front and with perhaps forty surviving cars ahead.\nWe roared through Grenoble, the street lamps sparkling in the frost and showing us the first flurries of falling snow and on to Vizille, bent on building up time for the hills ahead.\n\"GAP-MONACO. This itinerary has been chosen because of the difficulties it presents even in fine weather. According to the weather conditions during this period of snow, ice and even landslides, these difficulties may suddenly increase and render most arduous certain stretches over passes and through gorges. We therefore recommend the greatest caution and would also draw your attention to the fact that in the mountains and going through the villages competitors may be hindered by herds of cattle being moved and the parking of agricultural machinery, etc.\"\nThe road was now completely snow-covered and our average dropped below the set speed. Slowly the time we had built up began to slip away. Suddenly we were aware of the dreaded red glow of many tail lights ahead. Cars were slipping and failing to climb a steep incline. We stopped too and tumbled out to push, shove and coax the Magnette. People were fitting chains, letting air out of their tyres, pushing and levering. Eventually our chance came and Alan Colinson, who was nearest the wheel, leapt in and got on the move again. We reached the top of the Col Bayard and began a slow descent to Gap. Everyone was tight for time and many immediately raced away on the downhill, only to discover too late that the surface was like a skating rink. Cars were going off the road in all directions. I remember, in my terror, recognising a Zephyr, a Jaguar 120 Coupé and Gregor Grant's Magnette. It was the most expensive five kilometres of the rally, but we scraped safely past the cars' graveyard and into Gap.\nWe managed to refuel and began to dither about whether to fit chains. The roads in Gap were clear and everywhere crews were having the same argument, but our time was up.\nFor a few kilometres all was well. But as soon as we began to climb, the speed dropped back and the car slipped all over the place. Down into the next valley, briefly along the bottom and then off and up again. This time the increasing daylight showed there were dizzy drops on the right hand side and no retaining wall of any sort. I think we were all terrified and there were murmurs about slowing down. I had certainly never been on such a frightening road, not in full daylight, not in summer, not even at a touring speed. But we were losing time rapidly.\nHalfway up the Col St Jean, which was only the first of three 4,000 ft passes on this stage, we were again on deep packed snow, with a polished ice surface. In Seynes-les-Alpes we could stand it no more, and by now, unless our speed was substantially increased, there was no point in continuing. Several cars with chains fitted had already clanked by us and their advice was obvious. Crouching and lying in the slush, we fitted our chains.\nAt La Javie, where the first special stage ended and the next immediately began, Reg stamped the card and handed it to me to make the calculations. And though I did not realise it then, our time meant exclusion by more than six minutes.\nWorking it out later, I realised we had averaged 29 mph, which would not have cost us many penalties in any British rally, but was fatal on the Monte. Still, we were still unbent and we carried on round the other special stages, oblivious of our exclusion, but no longer hoping to do well.\nOn the long final descent, the long journey's cold began to ebb out of the metal of the Magnette. The blue sky opened wide enough to show the sun. Eucalyptus and yellow mimosa grew beside the road. We soon got ahead of schedule on the last straights beside the sparkling Var and pulled up to lose some time and straighten out the tangled mess inside the car.\nThe final control was at the Monaco frontier. We checked the car automatically for the technical inspection, signed the form declaring we had not had an accident and parked the car.\nBy the time we got to the Metropole Hotel I was shivering and nursing the biggest headache of all time. The bar was crowded with hearty British competitors making a remarkable recovery. I confessed my ills to Reg Phillips, who bought me a strange, revolting quinine drink called Amer Picon; with that I retired to bed and did not wake until the next day.\nOn Saturday, the best 100 cars took part in the 325 km mountain circuit test. None of the Magnettes and only one of the Austins qualified. The following morning the very tired survivors turned out to race five laps round the Grand Prix circuit. Whilst the rain fell steadily outside, I watched the racing from my bed. The cars came into my view around the Café de Paris, down the short straight past the nightclubs, into the long right-hander and out of sight round the Station hairpin. Not a bad grandstand at all.\nEventually the last car slid round the last corner to the chequered flag; an unnatural quiet descended on the town and the 25th Monte Carlo Rally was over. The winner; a privately-entered Sunbeam with a Norwegian crew that beat the works cars. Best British entry, Gerry Burgess, in a private Zephyr, came fourth; Jaguars with Ronnie Adams, Cecil Ward and Ian Appleyard took the team prize and the Ladies Cup went to Sheila Van Damm and Anne Hall in their Sunbeam. The best Magnette was Geoff Holt, classified at 178th, with Len Shaw 202nd, and us at 237th.\nIt was some comfort to find that people who did well were mostly those of whom one had often heard before. Experience and ability counted. I resolved to seek both in the future.\nOur thanks to 'Old Stager' for their permission to reproduce this edited version of Willy Cave's longer article first published in 1997.\nWilly Cave was ultimately highly successful in his quest for more experience and honours. He won an Alpine Cup in 1956 with Paddy Hopkirk in a TR3 and achieved 3rd, 4th and 6th places in the RAC Rally with a variety of drivers. His last 'modern' rally was the 1969 Monte Carlo with Peter Jopp in an Abingdon prepared Austin 1800 when they won the 'Best All-British Entry' award.\nClassic rallying began some 22 years later, and Willy has been active on the scene from the start. In 1991 he navigated John Sprinzel to 2nd in class in the Pirelli Marathon, while other honours include 3rd overall in the 6th Monte Carlo Challenge in a Volvo Amazon with Mike Corns, and 2nd overall and 1st in class in the Targa Espana with Mike Cornwell in a Porsche 356. And so, on to 2005……..\nIn 2005 Mike Cornwell and Willy Cave decided that something should be done to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Willy's appearance on the international rallying scene. They needed a Magnette, and a suitable car had to be found. They settled upon KUX 460, a very original 1954 'tin top' ZA, and entered it for the 2005 Winter Challenge, a gruelling 5 day event starting in Maastricht in the Netherlands and running through the Alps to Monte Carlo. The car was pulled apart and reassembled in rally trim. Only limited modifications are allowed so the running gear was left pretty standard but period rally mods were incorporated - the fitting of a Halda and extra 'clocks', rally seats, better spot lights and so on.\nArriving in a chilly Maastricht on 6 February for the start, Mike and Willy were greeted by Register members Günter Graskamp and Henk Kroese who not only interviewed the pair but also nobly assisted in the final fettling of the brakes - Mike, being mainly a Porsche man, welcomed some assistance on the rather agricultural Abingdon set-up.\nGG: Have you and Mike rallied together before?\nGG: How did you come to be accepted for the BMC team in 1955?\nGG: How did they hear of you - had you been a professional navigator?\nWC: No, I was working for the BBC, but I did a lot of club rallies. I've always been an amateur except in 1956 when I worked for Standard Triumph.\nGG: Is there a secret to becoming a good navigator?\nWC: My secret is to keep calm. Check everything: where is the river, did we pass the railway crossing, is there a church, is the direction correct, where is the sun, look at the compass……and then check again before we leave for the next control.\nGG: What are your memories of the rally 50 years ago?\nWC: I don't have good memories about that. The cars were too heavy and underpowered. We had luggage for three, spare wheels, two sets of snow chains, a heavy jack…..\nGG: With these bad memories in mind, what is your impression sitting in a Magnette 50 years later?\nWC: This rally is really something special for me, though I can't remember the original Magnette in detail.\nGG: May I ask how old you are now?\nAfter this Gunter and Henk presented Willy Cave with a Register sweat shirt and left him to study the route maps - to check and recheck!\nAlas, Willy's navigational skills were to no avail. Early on in the rally the Magnette lost a lot of time thanks to a faulty fuel pump, and they were never able to make this up, eventually retiring on the last stage. A sad end, but Willy remains indefatigable: less than a month later he was again in the left hand seat in the Alps, this time in a Mini Cooper, and he shows no sign of slowing down - a true 'Old Stager'!\nRead more about the car.

Luckily, this service was fast! In less than an hour the technician was here and got to work straight away. He found that one of the torsion springs was broken, and replaced them both to make sure it won't give us any trouble. Really fast and impressive work! This is a great company to call if you need anything fixed ASAP, we'll definitely keep their number close.\nHow scared I got when I saw the overhead door coming down and not stopping in the presence of my cat. I thought my silly pet would move but she froze there till I grabbed her the last minute. I called your company at once and was desperate for immediate service. The person on the phone assured me that someone would be in my house soon and they did send someone fast. The technician just had to adjust the sensors but all the same he checked the balance and force of the door, too. He was great and very professional.\nWe didn't want to just trust anybody for the service of our electric opener. It was apparent that there was something wrong with the reverse system and we wanted to be sure that the problem would be fixed right since it was related to our safety. We practically checked out many garage door companies but the only one which struck us as a good professional was Garage Door Repair Maplewood. It was an excellent choice. The technician was experienced and completely devoted to the repair task at hand. Not only did he fix the problem but also checked the whole system.\nIt wasn't the first time I was calling Maplewood Garage Door Repair. Though, till now I just needed a normal routine service or help replacing the bottom seal. This time, it was obvious that the problem was bigger. I explained how the door moved and they immediately suspected the garage door springs. The spring problem was confirmed by the technician, who came to my home later. The door wouldn't open right because the springs needed adjustment. It was amazing that they were able to tell me on the phone what was wrong with the door but then again, they have experience.\nI have been using the services of your company for some time now and I am really pleased. It hasn't been a time when the technicians were late or didn't do a good job. On the contrary, they keep surprising me with their knowledge and expertise every time they come for services.

In its early days Christchurch was particularly beset with the problem of water-borne diseases such as dysentery and typhoid. In 1874 it had the highest death rate of any centre in New Zealand.\nWith this as a background, in 1875 the Christchurch Drainage Board was formed and construction on Christchurch’s first pump station and first piped network was started in the late 1870s.\nThe original Number One Pump Station on the corner of Tuam St and Mathesons Rd is still standing (minus its smoke stack) and is a privately owned demolition sale yard.\nNow a vast network of 2,679 kilometres of public wastewater pipes, 30,817 manholes and 239 pumping, lift and vacuum stations continuously convey wastewater to the Christchurch Wastewater Treatment Plant for treatment and disposal.\nCompared to other New Zealand cities, Christchurch is much flatter and, due to its unique environmental features, has its own particular wastewater network challenges. Pumping is required on the plains as the ground is often too flat for gravity alone to naturally move the wastewater load along. For more information on the Christchurch wastewater system, see facts and figures.\nIt is important that wastewater gets to the treatment plant as soon as possible to avoid odour generated from its decay. The length of time wastewater takes will depend on the distance from the treatment plant (one to 24 hours maximum).\nChristchurch has a particular problem with this as it has one of the flattest wastewater systems in the world. Where the volume of wastewater is not sufficient to cause a rapid flow, or where the pipe grades are too flat, it is sometimes necessary to flush extra water down line through the pipes to move wastewater along.\nBark biofilters are used in 33 locations to treat odours from the wastewater network.\nThe Christchurch Wastewater Treatment Plant at Bromley treats the wastewater from all of urban Christchurch (as well as Tai Tapu). The average daily flow is 185,000,000 litres per day. The highly treated wastewater is discharged through a 1.8 metre diameter pipe which has its outlet 3 kilometres into the Pacific Ocean off South New Brighton.\nThe Akaroa Harbour treatment plants have to cope with the wastewater from large numbers of tourists so the type and amount of wastewater that arrives at the treatment plants can change quite dramatically from winter to summer and even from weekday to weekend or on busy public holidays. This can cause variations in the treatment process.\nThe standard of the treated wastewater is monitored by the Council and Environment Canterbury to meet the resource consent conditions.\nMany of the treatment plants will have upgrades or changes in the near future, including the Akaroa wastewater scheme, the Lyttelton Harbour wastewater scheme and the Wainui wastewater scheme.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

Therefore, you will see a dramatic decrease in hearings from now until the end of the session.\nDuring the past week, the Department of Human Services released their Spring Rebalance report and Caseload forecast. Both reports are tools used by the Legislature in their overall view of the budget and resources available.\nDHS reported overall that they have no current General Fund request - no additional funds needed at this time to balance their budget - and an overall $51 million in potential excess General Fund available.\nThe Department also shared their most current Caseload forecast. The forecast is also a key budget tool that shows changes in numbers of individuals DHS is serving. Overall, there is an expected continued increase in the DHS caseload for Aging & People with Disabilities and in-home care continuing to gain in consumers (this relates to Medicaid). The Committee discussed the factors which includes demographics, more individuals without family to help provide care, geographic separation from family and other factors).\nYou can read the most recent Caseload Forecast presentation here: https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2017R1/Downloads/CommitteeMeetingDocument/131170.\nThis week there will continue to be further discussions in the Legislature on PERS, cost containment and revenue/transportation packages as the Legislature grapples with how to move towards the budget work to be done that will bring the Session to a close. O4AD will continue to stay closely engaged in this process in order to update advocates and other stakeholders. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or for more information.\nHearings This WeekWith the second deadline having now occurred for policy bills, there will be a dramatic decrease in the number of bills up for hearing. However, you will see more action in Ways & Means. This does not apply to bills that are currently in Ways & Means, Rules or Revenue. The Senate has announced that they are now on a one hour notice for Committee hearings - a Senate Committee that is going to hear a bill or 'work' a bill need only give a one hour notice before holding the hearing. This can make it challenging to follow the hearing schedule - we recommend staying in close contact with the Oregon Legislative website which is updated to reflect new hearings.

Both populations are currently provided services through Oregon Project Independence, older adults have statewide access and people with disabilities have services through the Pilot Program in five geographic areas around the state. This cost effective, programmatically efficient program has allowed individuals to stay in their own home and own community and avoid premature or unnecessary entrance into Medicaid or facility based care. The Legislature cannot afford to NOT fund this program for seniors and people with disabilities. Moving individuals from OPI into Medicaid would result in an immediate 50% cost increase to the General Fund at a minimum.\nO4AD has released Talking Points on the importance of protecting funding for OPI. You can access these talking points HERE.\nYou can contact Ways & Means legislators to let them know the importance of this program. You can access their contact information HERE.\nOur message is simple - Protect Funding for OPI at Current Funding Levels.\nYou can also access other talking points and information on OPI via O4AD's website - HERE.\nTHANK YOU for your continued work on protecting funding for OPI!\nO4AD Legislative Conference CallO4AD is pleased to host our weekly Legislative Conference Call on Friday, June 9 at 11 am. We will be joined by n4a, the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging & Disabilities, for a Federal Policy update.\nDeadline Week for Policy BillsOregon's Legislature continues to move ahead even with no clear direction on a revenue package, consensus on a transportation package or a vote yet on the Provider Tax bills. However, this week, a short week due to the Memorial Day holiday, is the deadline week for Policy Bills. All bills that are not already in Ways & Means, Rules or Revenue must have had a Work Session by Friday, June 2 in order to continue to move through the process. This means the bill would have already had a work session in the originating chamber, been to a vote on that Chamber's floor, then been referred to the 2nd Chamber's appropriate policy committee and must now have a Work Session by June 2 and then head to that Chamber's floor for vote.\nO4AD will update our bill tracking once this deadline passes in order to keep up updated on the latest in policy moving ahead.\nNow that the Legislature moves forward out of policy work, with some exceptions, the conversation moves very quickly to budget. The Co Chairs of Ways & Means and their Subcommittee Co Chairs are working through different budget scenarios. Due to the uncertainty of potential revenue sources, and other obligations or priorities, the budget writers are presented with unique challenges in crafting budgets that address a number of scenarios - increases in revenue, decreases in revenue, flat revenue, increases in potential revenues forecasts, decreases in potential revenue forecasts, and other contingencies. This leaves advocates for aging and disability programs with significant work over the next month! Please stay updated with O4AD for ways YOU can engage to protect OPI funding.\nHearings This WeekDue to the upcoming deadline, please visit O4AD's website for the most recent bill tracking report. You may access this HERE.\nYou may also access our most recent bill calendar HERE.\nWe will issue a full update after the deadlines on Friday.\nAs O4AD continues to work on protecting funding for Oregon Project Independence for both older adults and people with disabilities, Legislators tell us they are hearing from YOU! They are hearing about the importance of this program from advocates, constituents, OPI consumers and others. THANK YOU for your hard work on this important and critical issue to older adults and people with disabilities. YOUR VOICE matters in this important conversation on how Oregon will fund services and supports during the 2017-19 biennium. It is essential that we do not balance budgets on the backs of our most vulnerable populations.\nO4AD has released Talking Points on the importance of protecting funding for OPI. You can access these talking points HERE. Please take a moment to share these points with your Legislator - regardless of the Committees where they serve, their support for OPI with their colleagues is critical.\nYou can also contact Ways & Means legislators to let them know the importance of this program.

During that time period this general style were referred to as \"cocked hats\". At the peak of its popularity, the cocked hat (tricorn) varied greatly in style and size, and was worn not only by the aristocracy, but also as common civilian dress, and as part of military and naval uniforms.\nThe hat's most distinguishing characteristic was that three sides of the brim were turned up (cocked) and either pinned, laced or buttoned in place to form a triangle around the crown. The hat was typically worn with the point facing forward.\nHISTORY: The tricorn appeared as a result of the evolution of the broad-brim round hat. By pledging (binding) the brims, a triangular shape was obtained. This shape was favored by Spanish soldiers and in 1667, war broke out between France and Spain in the Spanish Netherlands. During the subsequent military struggle, its use spread to the French armies. The style was brought back to France, where its usage spread to the French population and the royal court of King Louis XIV, who made it fashionable throughout Europe, both as a civilian and military wear. They remained one of the predominant European styles of hat throughout the 18th century; however, by the 1800's they soon became out of style to be replaced by the bicorne.\nIn the United States, only the first five Presidents, from George Washington to James Monroe, wore this style of hat according to the fashion of the 18th century. James Monroe earned the nickname \"The Last Cocked Hat\" because of this.\nWhat a great product from a great seller!", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

We noticed one instance where the changedate value included \"timeweighted\". How would \"timeweighted\" appear in the pi tag attributes?\n@Tim: AFAIK, there is no timeweighted attribute but a CalcMode attribute of a totalizer point (derived from a totalizer point class) can have 'timeweighted' as value. I imagine this is what the tool is reporting about.\nThis is the value of attribute and not the attribute name itself.\nThanks Mathieu, so the Changedate value actually contained a value of \"timeweighted, 7/22/2013 4:25:51 PM\". Our expected changedate value was only 7/22/2013 4:25:51 PM. What would cause the 'timeweighted' to appear?\n@Tim: I couldn't think of something different than a configuration change on that PI Point. Can you get the value of the changer attribute, this should tell you would made the change if different from the last time.\nIs the ptsecurity attribute is defined correctly to allow only administrators to change the configuration?\nPoints can belong to different Point classes and different point classes have different point attributes.\nTags that are serviced by the PI Totalizer subsystem are member of the \"Totalizer\" point class which has an attribute \"CalcMode\" that I believe is unique for \"Totalizer\" point class - at least with the default point classes.\nWhen retrieving the configuration of \"Totalizer\" tags using PI SMT add-in for Microsoft Excel, I see \"CalcMode\" on the left hand side besides \"changedate\" attribute.\nIs it possible the information within \"CalcMode\" has been merged into \"changedate\" within your application?\nBecause all point classes use the attributes from \"Base\" class plus additional ones, I suggest storing configuration data separated by point classes within your application - if this makes sense to you.\nWhat's the purpose of your application? Are you auditing the point table?\nIf you could please attach a spreadsheet generated using PI Tag Configurator, which is an add-in of Excel, with the configuration of this specific tag, we might be able to help you better.\nIf you don´t know how to do that, please let us know and we will help you!\nsmall problem with that is that i cant reproduce this scenario. one of our customers found this issue. I just would like to know some possibilities where \"Timewheighted\" would appear in the changedate attribute of a tag. From the discussion thus far it seems like it could be stemming from a Totalizator point class.\nWhat is the purpose of the Totalizer point class, what would be a scenario where someone would use this class?\nI can only assume that your \"tuning\" application changes tag attributes used by Exception and Compression. I understand the motivation for the attempt to make a PI system managers life easier. However to apply good Exception and Compression settings it's not only necessary to have a good understanding how Exception and Compression works. Rather one also needs a good understanding of the process data and about the \"interface\" collecting the data and servicing tags in PI. This said, I wouldn't trust into any kind of automation but prefer maintaining settings manually. This doesn't imply to find a good setting for each individual tag or that each individual tag needs to be set up manually.\nBased on data types and value ranges, basic settings can be suggested that will deliver good results in the majority of cases and make a fine tuning necessary only for a smaller percentage of tags only i.e. those supposed to record pretty busy signals. I consider reviewing recorded data a necessary requirement. Asking the \"data users\" for their opinion is a good practice. Signals that require changes can usually be grouped, so settings need to be evaluated for a smaller subset of tags only and could than be applied for others of the same kind. PI SMT Tag Builder add-in for Microsoft Excel is my preferred tool for this kind of work.\nPI Totalizer Subsystem is a calculation engine belonging to the so called PI Server applications. Because of the specific configuration requirements (additional attributes) of PI Totalizer Subsystem all belonging tags are using \"Totalizer\" point class. I recommend not treating tags with pointclass = \"Totalizer\" with your \"tuning\" application since this may have a direct impact on calculation results. PI Totalizer may report status \"Configure\", \"Bad Sample\" or similar because of the changed configuration until the next reset (clock scheduled or event triggered) occurs.\nHi Rhys, not a problem! I think I've got the answer to my question and have forwarded the issue over to our developers to be fixed. If you'd like to know more about our product you can visit our website and download a free trial of CompressionInsight. You can also contact me at tim.read@patterndiscovery.com.\nAgain, thanks to all who helped with this question.

Steven Gerrard’s unfortunate loss of footing against the Blues has become the defining moment of the Reds’ inability to secure the Premier League title back in 2014 despite seemingly having one hand on the trophy. With the Anfield outfit once trying to secure their first top flight trophy since the inauguration of the new format, Sunday’s clash against Chelsea held a similar amount of importance and once again there was a slip – this time from Liverpool’s Andy Robertson.

(10) I seek you with my whole heart. Do not let me stray from your commands. (11) I have hidden your Word in my heart so that I might not sin against you. (12) Blessed are you, Yahweh! Teach me your decrees. (13) With my lips I rehearse all the judgments of your mouth. (14) In following the way of your statutes I rejoice as though (I were rejoicing) in great riches. (15) On your precepts I meditate, and consider your ways. (16) In your decrees I find delight. I will not forget your Word.\nThe first verse of the Beth stanza opens with a question, “How should a young man keep his life’s path pure?” The rest of the segment provides the answer. By using the same word, “obey” (vs. 9), as he did previously (vss. 4, 5, & 8), the psalmist establishes obedience as the central theme of this segment and links it to the previous one.\nA question of interpretation arises with the verb translated “keep pure” (vs. 9 in the NIV). An earlier translation (KJV) renders this verb as “cleanse.” Was the author asking how a young man maintains his purity (NIV) or how he regains his purity after sinning (KJV)? While both senses may be conveyed by the Hebrew verb, the context pushes us in the direction of the NIV’s interpretive translation (vss. 10 & 11). The psalmist first asks God to keep him from straying (vs. 10) and then gives the avoidance of sinful behavior as his motive for hiding God’s Word in his heart (vs. 11). Three other words are repeated in this stanza: “your Word” (vss. 9 & 16), “path/way” (vss. 9 & 15), and “heart” (vss. 10 & 11).\nOnly those who delight in obeying God’s Word maintain a lifestyle that honors him.\nWhat does hiding God’s Word in our hearts (vs. 11) specifically entail? Believers over the centuries have considered this a strong exhortation to commit important scripture passages to memory. This way, verses needed at moments when we might be tempted to sin are readily available for our protection. Jesus modeled this for us at the beginning of his earthly ministry in his encounter with Satan in the wilderness (Mt. 4:1-11). In each of three temptations, Jesus responded by quoting verses from Deuteronomy. First, when tempted by Satan to turn stones into bread to assuage his hunger, he quoted Deuteronomy 8:3. (Mt. 4:3 & 4). Then when Satan suggested that he jump from the pinnacle of the temple to prove that he was God’s Son, he quoted Deuteronomy 6:16 (Mt. 4:5-7). Finally, when offered dominion over the kingdoms of the world in exchange for bowing the knee to Satan, Jesus quoted from Deuteronomy 6:13.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

The first term uses the projected value of x based only on previous information, as in the exponential filter. But instead of just taking the last filtered value, the best estimate of the trend is also added to account for the straight line assumption. The second term uses the correction for the newly-observed input at time k. The exponential filter factor a weights the past vs the new information.\nEquation 2 is an estimate of the trend, exponentially filtered with its own filter constant g. The first term uses the best estimate from past information, and the second term uses the correction for the most recently observed trend, y[k] - y[k-1] . The exponential filter factor g weights the past vs the new information.\nIf the input signal becomes a ramp (constant slope), then this filter output will track the ramp, approaching it asymptotically. If the slope of the ramp is changed, the filter output will again approach the new ramp. For that reason, this filter is competitive with a linear least squares filter, which also makes a straight line assumption. This is an IIR approximation of the FIR linear least squares filter.\nAlpha-beta filters are based on the same assumptions as double exponential smoothing. There are estimates of two variables, one the derivative of the other. The derivative is assumed constant for prediction. Upon receipt of new data, both the variable and its derivative estimates are updated. There are two parameters for the weighting of prediction vs correction: alpha and beta. It should have the same general characteristics as double exponential smoothing, although there may be no published comparison of this. See the Wikipedia article.\nOther signal models can be used. For instance, the predictions can include factors based on a sine wave. This is common practice in fields such as economics where seasonal adjustements are made. That is beyond the scope of this guide.\nA comb filter adds a delayed version of a signal to itself. This is used mainly in some specific electrical engineering cases where a signal at a particular known frequency is of interest.

We encourage proposals for individual papers or for sessions of three papers, and proposals using various media from creative practitioners, researchers and postgraduates whose practice engages with the conference themes.\nA series of informal events around innovation, running from 16 to 18 February, have been organised around the visits to Lancaster University of Lucy Kimbell (Clark Fellow in Design Leadership at Saïd Business School, University of Oxford), Daria Loi (Research scientist, Intel USA) and Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino (CEO and Co-Founder, Tinker.it!, London). For more information, click here.\nOn Thursday 15 and Friday 16 October, around fifty people gathered for the launch event of the Experimentality programme.

The blog postings on the presentations and discussion from the workshop can now be viewed online.\nTo coincide with the launch event of Experimentality, we are launching this new, community website for the programme. Powered by the open source software Drupal, this website will provide up-to-date information about forthcoming events in the programme, viewable by category (workshops or art events) or in calendar form. As the year progresses, it will also contain documentation in different formats of the individual events - a record of talks, presentations and performances, but also of the ensuing discussion and debate.\nBut it also provides an opportunity to get involved in the programme in a more interactive way. You can register on the website, using the link at top right, and then create a profile indicating your interests and activities. You can then also create your own Experimentality blog, posting ideas and thoughts that relate to the questions being pursued in the programme. Importantly, you can comment on the blog postings by others, including the description of individual events, which will enable us to explore topics in more depth than is always possible during the events. You will also shortly be able to upload a profile picture and follow site activity using Twitter.\nWe hope that this website will extend participation in the programme to those unable to attend events, but also to create a space for more continuous discussion and sharing amongst participants.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

It’s expected to open in two weeks at 43-29 Crescent Street, not far from Jackson Avenue.\nRockrose Development Corporation, the lot’s owner, has come to an agreement with the New York City Food Truck Association, which has recruited a group of trucks interested in participating, said David Weber, president of the trade group.\nThey include Rickshaw Dumpling truck, the Treats Truck, Coolhaus ice cream sandwiches, the Milk Truck, Cupcake Stop, Eddie’s Pizza, Frites ‘N Meats and the Kimchi Taco Truck.\nInitially, Mr. Weber said, three or four trucks could gather at lunchtime in the lot, and more on the weekends, and for special events, the lot could ultimately accommodate 16 trucks, he said. At the start, 5,000 square feet of the 11,000-square-foot parking lot will be given over to food trucks; but the entire lot could be devoted to trucks if the location proves to be popular.\nFood-truck lots have long been a fixture in Austin, Tex., Portland, Ore., and greater Los Angeles, where the Southern California Food Vendors Association — which has 130 members — runs five food-truck lots. The New York City Parks Department has had several truck set up outside the former Tavern on the Green in Central Park since last year.\nIn Long Island City, the truck lot is near two CitiCorp buildings and a major Department of Health office, all rich with office workers, and , Ms. Dunphy said, Jet Blue and the new law school of the City University of New York are scheduled to open buildings nearby early next year.\nAlso, she said, a Dumpster pool, one of the 8-foot-wide, 22-foot-long mobile pools that have brought impromptu swimming to city neighborhoods in recent years, is scheduled to be installed across from the truck lot in August.\nThe association and Rockrose are still negotiating about who will be responsible for the ongoing operation of the lot, and about the rental or license fees that food trucks would pay to occupy the space. It is possible, Mr. Weber said, that the trucks would arrange directly for monthly sublicenses for their spaces with Rockrose.\nMr. Weber said the truck association is considering several other locations, “and we’d like to hear from New Yorkers where else they’d like food-truck-courts to be,” he said.\nSo, readers, what areas cry out for food-truck invasion?

Several of these companies are soon to become publicly traded and available to any American who wants to invest in these billion-dollar startups.\nThe news of potential initial public offerings (IPOs) for many immigrant-founded companies comes at a time when a study from the National Foundation for American Policy finds that 55%, or 50 of 91, of the country’s $1 billion startup companies had at least one immigrant founder. Many of these immigrant-founded companies are valuable. “The collective value of the 50 immigrant-founded companies is $248 billon, which is more than the value of all the companies listed on the stock market of many countries, including Argentina, Columbia, Peru, Portugal and Ireland,” according to the research. The $248 billion figure likely underestimates the underlying value of these 50 companies.\nUber, cofounded by Canadian immigrant Garrett Camp, is the most valuable U.S. billion-dollar company with at least one immigrant founder, with a valuation of $72 billion. However, the Wall Street Journal recently reported that if Uber proceeds with an anticipated initial public offering in 2019, its value could reach $120 billion. “That eye-popping figure is nearly double Uber’s valuation in a fundraising round two months ago and more than General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles are worth combined,” reported the newspaper.\nSpaceX, founded by South African immigrant Elon Musk, and WeWork, co-founded by Israeli-born immigrant Adam Neumann, are the second and third most valuable U.S. billion-dollar startups with an immigrant founder, valued at $21 billion and $20.2 billion respectively. Neither company is expected to have an initial public offering in 2019.\nSource: National Foundation for American Policy; valuations from \"Billion Dollar Startup Club,\" Wall Street Journal, taken at various dates prior to October 1, 2018.\nOther valuable immigrant-founded billion-dollar companies include Stripe ($20 billion), Slack ($7.1 billion), Moderna Therapeutics ($7 billion), Robinhood ($5.6 billion), Wish ($4.3 billion), Instacart ($4.2 billion), Houzz ($4 billion), Credit Karma ($3.5 billion), Tanium ($3.5 billion), Zoox ($3.2 billion), CrowdStrike ($3 billion), Unity Technologies ($2.8 billion), Oscar Health Insurance ($2.7 billion), Zenefits ($2 billion) and Avant ($2 billion). Note: These valuations are as of October 1, 2018. Instacart completed a round of funding in mid-November that values the company at $7.87 billion, according to Reuters.\n“Other big tech startups in the 2019 IPO queue, according to people familiar with the matter, include workplace-messaging platform Slack Technologies Inc. as well as a raft of smaller but closely watched companies including food-delivery service Postmates Inc., security firms CrowdStrike Inc. and Cloudflare Inc., and videoconferencing-software provider Zoom Video Communications Inc.,” reported the Wall Street Journal.\nAll five of the companies mentioned above have at least one immigrant founder. There is no startup visa that allows a foreign-born individual to obtain permanent residence (a green card) for founding a business. That’s why immigrant entrepreneurs are almost always refugees or first sponsored by employers or family members. Even then, an individual in H-1B status may wait years for his or her green card before setting off to start a new business.\nImmigrant-founded billion-dollar companies employ an average of more than 1,200 employees per company (the vast majority of the jobs in the United States), according to the National Foundation for American Policy. These companies are also among the most exciting and valuable privately held businesses in America.

Athirapally was always on top of my list, not just because of its breathtaking pictures posted all over on internet but every time whenever I made a plan, it got cancelled.

This time Arun and his brother Anil joined me. We already had booking at one on the resort there. After dumping all our bags and typical Kerala meals we headed toward Athirapally waterfall. Luckily rain was stopped by the time we reached there. Athirappilly falls is situated 1000 ft above sea level on the Chalakudy river and one of the major attraction in Kerala.\nWe could hear water falling sound, walked for 5 mins and then the majestic waterfall started unrevealed itself, falling from a height of 80 feet.\nIt was breathtaking view, the majestic Athirapally water fall and I am sure you can forget everything there when you see and hear roaring sound of water falling from good height.\nIt was Friday, but place was crowded. I found people around me making more noise, shor sharaba than monkeys there. Imagine if you all alone there, mighty waterfall and scenic jungle around you.\nIt was time to get drenched, you can walk down to stony path which was a bit slippery and steep. But it turned out to be worth the pain. Hardly 1 km walk and then you can witness the power of water gushing down. It was more crowded, noisy but I made my way to reach at the vantage point. The force of the water falling splatters droplets all over us. It was like raining.\nForget about calmness of river, here its wild and roaring.\nRemember the epic waterfall scene in Bahubali? I was told some of the shooting was done here, though it was edited (vfx) later.\nAfter Athirapally waterfall, we drove further and next destination was Vazhachal waterfall.\nBefore we could reach Vazhachal , there is another another waterfall (3KM from Athirapally), I don’t remember the name but just beside the road with full flow, this waterfall will surely attract you to pull over your car and admire it.\nVazhachal waterfall is relatively calm, quiet ambience, more gradual comparatively to Athirapally. Well maintained, has small garden and benches to sit and watch the Vazhachal falls. I wont say this is waterfall but more like a river flowing in cascade rocks. But if you are visiting Athirapally, you can cover this place as well. Its just 5 km from Athirapally. The walk along the riverside can be simply soothing.\nDo I have to say, this is the perfect time to explore this side of Kerala? During Mansoon, waterfalls can be major attractions but driving here is absolute delight, I call these roads as snake roads, either side palm tree, rubber tree, coconut trees, frequent sights of mini waterfalls.\nOverall its place worth exploring.

{"best_of": 1, "echo": true, "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 0, "model": "opt-1.5b", "n": 1, "prompt": "Whether you like them or not, selfies are everywhere. More often than not, you must be finding yourself awkwardly being asked to pose for these selfies while your friends click them. Or you may also be the ones who love clicking these self-portraits for posting them on social media. No matter what side of the spectrum you lean on, it’s very evident these days that phone manufacturers are trying to entice buyers with handsets aimed at clicking great selfies. So if you’re on the lookout for selfie phones to buy in India, without pinching a wallet, we’ve prepared a list of best selfie phones under Rs 20,000.\nThe POCO F1 is the most value-for-money device available out there. It’s the only phone in the sub-Rs 20k bracket that offers the Snapdragon 845 processor. As for selfies, they are taken care of by a high-resolution 20MP front camera bearing an f/2.0 lens. In low light, this phone uses 4-in-1 pixel binning to capture great shots at the expense of resolution. And if you’re wondering, Xiaomi has indeed added a software-based portrait mode to the POCO F1. It even features a 12MP + 5MP dual-camera setup on its back.\nThe Realme U1 is an extremely stylish phone, which offers powerful specifications at an affordable price. Its design highlight is the tiny Dewdrop notch sitting on its front surface. This allows its display to occupy the entire front estate, creating a more immersive viewing experience. More importantly, this notch hides inside it a 25MP f/2.0 selfie camera with features like Night Shot Brightness and Back-Light Clarity, apart from of course, a portrait mode.\nRealme also offers another great selfie phone in the form of the Realme 2 Pro. This device comes with a 16MP front camera, but has better internals than the U1. However, its base model costs Rs 2,000 more than the U1.\nVivo V11’s full-screen front surface bears a tiny waterdrop notch, which hides a 25MP camera. Tons of AI-based features accompany this snapper, apart from a software-based portrait mode. The V11 is a beautiful all-round device, offering the benefits of dual rear cameras, the MediaTek P60 processor and 6GB of RAM. Powering the show on the phone is a 3,315mAh battery. A Pro model of this phone also exists, and offers lots of improvements in its specs at a higher cost.\nXiaomi’s Redmi Note series phones are unbeatable around the Rs 15k price range. The latest addition to this range is the Redmi Note 6 Pro, which features dual front cameras. The notch on its display plays home to a 20MP f/2.0 main camera and a 2MP depth sensor. This allows the smartphone to offer better bokeh effects than what a single camera would be able to. The Note 6 Pro offers an impressive set of specs, which include a 4,000mAh battery, a Snapdragon 636 processor and a dual rear camera setup.\nXiaomi also has another great selfie phone under Rs 20,000 in the form of the Mi A2, which comes with a portrait mode-equipped 20MP front camera.\nVivo and Oppo really know how to make great selfie phones. The F9 is not just alluring to look at due to its exquisite design, but it’s also well equipped in terms of specs. Its front camera is a 16MP unit, which comes with various beautification features as well as a portrait mode. On F9’s rear surface, OPPO has placed a 16MP + 2MP setup, which comes with a variety of features including the portrait mode. The other specifications of the handset include a 6.3-inch full HD+ display, MediaTek’s Helio P60 SoC, 4GB RAM and a 3,500mAh battery. If you can extend your budget slightly, then you can opt for the F9 Pro, which ships with a 25MP selfie shooter.\nThe Nova 3i overshoots the Rs 20,000 threshold by just Rs 990, which is the reason we’ve decided to include it anyways. The Huawei smartphone carries on it four cameras, two at the front and two at the back. The selfie setup is a 24MP + 2MP combination, which comes with scene detection, a portrait mode and beautification effects. The rear camera system on its this phone includes a 16MP primary snapper and a 2MP depth sensor. Powered by Kirin 710 SoC, the handset ships with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage onboard.\nThese are all the options you should consider if you want to purchase a great selfie phone under Rs 20,000.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

Then, if you press 2 or 3, it will show you something else. 2 takes you to the sprite sheets currently in use. 3 shows you all the bytes in the game. If you happen to have a cheat sheet of what each byte represents (say you hypothetically had the link https://datacrystal.romhacking.net/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.:RAM_map ), you can change things in the game. Some important ones: 016 is enemies, 039 toggles the power-up currently on screen, 704 is swim when set to 0, 754 is the size of the current player. 0 is big, 1 is small, and there are other values that do weird things. 756 is power-up state. 75A is lives, 75F and 760 represent world and level. 79F controls how long you will be invincible. There are many other fun things, but these are the ones that you will probably tinker with the most.\nUpdate time! So, this week, we looked at how each byte in memory can control different parts of a game. As you can guess from the paragraph above, we did this on Super Mario Bros. (Oh, quick note, this may cut off abruptly, because I am writing this past 12, and I don't know if Matt is at this minute rolling everything back; if he does, this will be an interesting entry.) It was pretty cool to see a goomba just suddenly turn into a piranha plant. The best part was typing in random values for the world and level, so you would get worlds that aren't normally in the game, but are still playable. Some are extremely interesting. If at all possible, you should try it out! I also enjoyed making myself invincible for as long as I wanted; I suspect that this could make the levels boring if over used… Oh well!\nNow, what have I accomplished in Portal Kombat this week? Well, I'm glad you asked. What I have done is get a major chunk of those aforementioned if statements done! For the first player, I have managed to get the Firesquid's weapons working perfectly well, in addition to the Guy and Gal's sword. I can't tell you how much time I spent troubleshooting why the weapon froze at a certain part or moved in the wrong direction. It was quite the challenge (and quite a lot of code) to be able to get the two sprites making up the sword to move in unison. Once I got all those sprites to work well for player one, I decided it would be a brilliant idea to just copy/paste those sections into the player 2 part. Well, it might still be, but I should probably make sure next time that I change all the player specific variables to the right person before trying it out next time. I ended up freezing player 1 while player 2's weapon was active because of this. More work! Yay!\nBut that's not all! As I hinted at above, the player 1 sprite now freezes whenever their weapon is in use. It makes sense to me! The longer your weapon, the longer you're stuck. I also have the basics of collision detection set up. At the moment, all it does is send player 2 straight to the point (100, 100). I've also realized that due to the way the code runs, player 1's stuff always goes first, so unless we go over synchronicity soon (maybe still not even then), player 1 will have a distinct advantage. Although, I could just overcome that with some more if statements… AHHHHH!! FRUSTRATION!!!!", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}
{"best_of": 1, "echo": true, "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 0, "model": "opt-1.5b", "n": 1, "prompt": "1. How long they can go without being sanitized/a little dirt never hurt nobody. Yes, it is true – since the beginning of the history of camp, parents have been mystified by the lack of interest in children over the idea of cleanliness. It is a thing. And despite labelling everything with the days of the week and providing a bag clearly marked for dirty laundry – that bag stays empty. At day camp, that special bag for their wet swimsuit and towel is ignored and that sopping wet swimsuit AND towel, with most of the sand from the beach, can be reliably found in midst of the crackers that they didn’t finish at the bottom of the backpack. Surprisingly, their spirits are never dampened by the lack of cleanliness and they get up the next day ready and willing to do it all over again.\n2. How to listen deeply. Camp provides an environment and opportunity for an expanse of time uncluttered by the use of technology and screens. With this gift of time comes the opportunity for deep listening: to what the natural world and its beauty are saying to each one of us in the rustling of trees and the song of birds; to each other and conversations that go uninterrupted as dreams and ideas are shared; to the call of the Sacred and mystery in all of us.\n3. How to carve… or bake bread, or paint, or play the drums, or learn a new game, or knit, or how to administer first aid, or any number of amazing things! Skills children learn at camp can become lifelong passions that engage their minds and encourage them to be creative. Warning: during or after camp, your child may express an interest in going to your closest craft store to pick up supplies to continue a quest for mastery of making friendship bracelets or another skill that catches your child’s interest!\n4. How to be a friend. There are never enough opportunities to learn how to be friendly and supportive to those around us. Camps open up opportunities for children to share time together – to make new friends and connect with old ones. Sharing meals together in community can foster great relationships. Camp Spirit thrives on the generosity of multi-generational volunteers, creating a safe environment that encourages interaction and friendship across all ages – elders and children, toddlers and youth – sharing wisdom and stories with one another.\n5. How to lead. Camps offer opportunities for youth and young adults to develop their leadership skills, skills that affirm each child for who they are, and skills in providing an environment of inclusion and authentic welcome. Leaders express care, respect, delight and joy in their jobs. Children learn how to lead by watching these leaders in action.\n6. How to sing. To all those parents and guardians out there, we are sorry – sorry that we taught songs that caught your child’s imagination and interest – so much so, that they sing them… all the time! In the car, in the bath, at dinnertime, hiking, biking, when they are supposed to be going to sleep, to annoy an older sibling (in the car, in the bath or when they are supposed to be sleeping). You get the idea. And we are a little bit sorry but, they are really fun songs and some of them even have amazing messages of love and hope!\n7. How they matter. Each child is affirmed for the beauty and gift of their spirit and life! It is a blessing to spend time with each one of them.\nChildren learn how long they can go without being sanitized.\nChildren learn how to listen to each other.\nChildren make friends across all ages.\nYouth and young adults develop leadership skills and children learn to care and respect from their leaders.\nChildren learn songs of love and hope.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

Wesley So still leads the tournament but his lead has narrowed to only one and a half points. The 2016 World Blitz Champion Sergey Karjakin dominated the day by scoring 6.5 points out of 9. He is now tied for second place in the overall standings with Levon Aronian. Maxime Vachier-Lagrave and Hikaru Nakamura are still also striking distance away from the leaders. With nine more rounds tomorrow, the tournament is still wide open, as a good or bad day for one of the leaders could completely change the outcome.\nThe rapid portion of Your Next Move came to an end with Wesley So winning the rapid portion with a round to spare. He now leads the pack with a comfortable advantage as his closest rivals, Levon Aronian and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave are three points behind. The next two days of blitz promise to bring a lot of action and excitement. Since nine games will be played on each day, a bad day for So could mean a complete turn around in the standings. However, in blitz, the wins are only worth one point, thus giving So a big edge over the rest of the field.\nThe first leg of the 2018 Grand Chess Tour, Your Next Move, kicked off in Lueven, Belgium today with three rapid games. After three rounds, Wesley So emerged as a clear leader with two wins and one draw. Interestingly enough, last year the American won the rapid portion of Leuven.

Concerned employers across the globe, including Singapore, are taking several measures to protect their staff (pregnant employees in particular) from the Zika virus.\nThe Zika virus is a mosquito-borne illness transmitted by infected Aedes albopictus or Aedes aegypti mosquitos. The Zika outbreak has become a serious concern, typically because so far, there is no medicine or vaccine available to treat or prevent Zika. From 2007 to 2016, Zika cases have been reported in more than 62 countries, affecting millions of people worldwide.\nAccording to the doctors, the Zika infection has the potential to pass from a pregnant female to her fetus, causing birth defects and even neurological problems in babies. In fact, microcephaly is one of the most severe fetal brain damages in unborn babies. Infected pregnant women or people, in general, often experience symptoms like red eyes, rashes, muscle pain, headaches, low grade fever, and pain in the joints. However, babies developing inside the womb can experience microcephaly.\nInfants with this problem are born with below average head size with the head circumference of less than 31.5 to 32cm. It shows that the brain has not developed normally. This can often be deadly because an underdeveloped brain fails to regulate and perform the functions that are vital to survive. However, children that do manage to survive have been found to face development delays and intellectual disabilities.\nThe Straits Time newspaper recently published an article on how Singaporean employers are going out of the way to protect their pregnant employees from Zika. The newspaper highlighted the employee protection efforts of 3E Accounting Pte Ltd during the Zika outbreak, one of the leading Singaporean accounting firms that has also earned the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment (TAFEP) Exemplary Employer Award for its progressive, responsible and fair employment practices.\nThe newspaper confirmed that 3E Accounting Pte Ltd has given its pregnant women employees the flexibility to work from home so that they don’t have to travel to & from work and expose themselves to the risk of getting infected. The Aedes specie of mosquitoes is recognised as aggressive daytime biters, increasing the risk of the Zika virus among those who travel to work during the day.\nFurthermore, Lawrence Chai, the managing director and owner of 3E Accounting Pte Ltd, has also bought $1,500 worth of mosquito repellents from Kuala Lumpur and installed them in his Singapore branch for his team of 26 employees to ensure they are well-protected from the risk of Zika.\n3E Accounting would like to thank The Straits Times for appreciating their efforts during the Zika outbreak and all staff and clients for their tremendous support.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

Physique 57 stands true to the ‘no pain, no gain’ motto—if you do a quick search on the cult workout online, you’ll find that it doesn’t shy away from claiming that it takes a lot of tough work to get through a class.\nHaving done a barre class before and wanting to explore more workouts this new year, I decided to give it a shot. An effective workout that makes you feel incredible inside and out? All for it.\nDespite not being a gym rat or someone who is always seen frequenting the latest hip and happening fitness studios, I would still consider myself moderately fit—I do yoga every now and then, I jog occasionally, and I make sure to reach a certain number of steps per week. Diet-wise, there’s still room for improvement but I do make sure to limit my meat intake and avoid too much sugar.\nYet the confidence I had in my fitness ability didn’t hinder my nerves from acting up. Prior to the Signature class I signed up for, I hit the gym for three consecutive days and continued reaching my steps per day. You know what they say: preparation is key, and with the first-class jitters I was feeling, I made sure to squeeze in some exercises a few days before class to make sure my body was conditioned enough.\nDesigned with lockers, floor-to-ceiling mirrors, ballet bars, and motivational fitness quotes, the Physique 57 franchise in BGC is a fresh, inspirational, and well-equipped space. Entering its spacious and well-lit studio—not to mention feeling its cool temperature and great ventilation—truly got me pumped to get sweating.\nMake sure you’ve got your closed-toe socks with non-slip soles ready, a comfortable (and cute!) workout outfit on, and your trusty water jug. Lastly, don’t forget to be there 15 minutes before your workout since classes start right on the dot.\nEach class is different, so expect something new with each visit. The Signature class I attended targeted the arms, legs, back, and abs—a full-body workout that even fitness buffs may find challenging.\nThe 1-hour class was a rigorous mix of strength training, cardio, and stretching, along with unique elements of dance. Prepare for a series of twists, turns, and pulses using resistance bands, weights, and a playground ball. Expect to be on the balls of your feet and feeling the fire in your muscles while trying to survive challenging reps—and boy, did I feel the burn!\nWith their signature thigh and seat sequences, and ab-centric exercises on the mat, expect your heart pumping, your adrenaline rising, and your body sweating. Sound tiring? Rightfully so, and I must say, well worth the money and pain. After overloading my muscles, I’d never felt more relieved to stretch in my entire life.\nDespite being an hour long, I felt that time flew by quicker because of how dynamic (and surprisingly fun) the sets were, not to mention the exhilarating workout playlist blasting during class! Our instructor, Mia Cabalfin, was also incredibly motivating and pumped us up all throughout, making sure to correct our form and call out words of encouragement when needed.\nThe verdict? A body that is satisfyingly sore all throughout. The day after, I felt the glorious aftermath of the whole-body workout: from my core to my glutes to my quads, from my biceps to my triceps.\nSeeing how effective the barre-based Physique 57 was in making my muscles work, it’s no wonder you can expect lean, sculpted muscles after just 8 sessions. I now understand why the workout has forged a dedicated community not just in New York, LA, and the Hamptons, but in Dubai, Bangkok, Mumbai, and most excitingly in Manila as well. Finishing a class endows you with a sense of accomplishment and makes you feel ready to take on the world.\nOverall, Physique 57 is everything that a workout should be: effective, efficient, and fun. Come out of the class empowered and motivated, feeling stronger than ever, and radiating confidence inside and out.\nWant to feel the total-body burn?

JESUS!\n(deep breath) I am happy.\nLast night I sang a solo at my choir concert. I am so proud! I was so nervous. I started learning it around 3pm. 2 hours in the car with Whitney Houston, 20 minutes with a karaoke track from iTunes and a lot of prayer. The devil fought me telling me I couldn’t do it, that I was worthless and needed to die. Not today, sir. Get out of my house. JESUS!\nThere were only 16 people in the audience – all family of the choir and a few church members. None of my friends showed up. I was so thankful to have my mom.\nI read from Proverbs and prayed that God would sing through me and to me, that He would give me the courage to open my mouth and use me as a vessel for His word, keeping my focus only on Him. This song is a vocal dance for Jesus. JESUS!\nMy whole body trembled. An hour or so before, I hit a wall – weak, dizzy, close to tears, barely able to eat. I sat down a few times during the concert but decided not to take my PRN for my heart that I sometimes do during concerts. I didn’t want to interfere with the Spirit. My head and mouth hurt all day. I had decompensated to confusion, yelling at cars, then not moving. But I did it. Just for God. No practice with the choir. A lick and a prayer. All for God. Only for God.\nI watched the video when I got home. It is the first time I’ve been proud of my work, didn’t hate the sound of my voice. I felt free.\nMy hair blows softly over my face.\nI can’t explain the joy sitting here brings me. Folding laundry. Listening instead of just hearing. The deep appreciation of rising from the ashes, of being released from pain. I see colors. I taste. I feel God again.\n19 days of pain have led to this beauty. I am set free. I savor the feeling. I know it is just for a time but this time is mine.\n(zap) I look forward to projects. I eat colors, swallow time. I am pink and the whole world sings. Of joy, of deliverance, of me. My face smiles without me. I watch. She is beautiful when she’s happy.\nThis week I realistically contemplated going in. Today I don’t need to. When I see my doctor tomorrow the pain will be a story. I will be able to talk, unlike last time, and to think. I think. Anyway, there is such a difference. Like flipping a switch. I am glad to be on this side.\nI could not appreciate gift without loss. Now I take it in, prepare and wait. Rest. Thank you, God. Weepin’ may endure for a night but joy comes in the morning. Amen.\nAs my muscles being to hurt again, remember this feeling.\nI used all my energy today.\nAt least I can poop.\n7 If I can feel such joy on Earth, can you imagine what it’s like in heaven?\n13 I want to paint the sky with a dance and pour out the rain.\nFG And for things to be okay.\n3 Jesus will like my unicorn.\n7 And I want to ride a sunset.\nFG I know, baby. He does.\nIn writing tonight about sadness and pain I am reminded of joy. I felt such joy singing today. I sang with my choir at a nursing home and for a few moments all of it was gone. God sang through me and I was filled with hope. My director said he’s going to call me Merry now because I’m so joyful. It’s true. Singing brings me such joy, especially gospel.

This collector of rare vintage clothing, and storyteller about the authentic and timeless materials used to create it, has evolved her collection’s concept entirely. To blaze a trail for today’s designers who appreciate the classic styles of clothing, Smith partnered with Gerber’s own Mary McFadden.\nMary was able to make Smith’s dream a reality, catapulting her into the 3D-world and exploring the potential of taking 250 years of fashion to the 21st century.\n“The Darnell Collection is important on so many levels, but perhaps the highest being its role in bringing the true art of fashion to life. It serves as an inspiration, and allows us to delve into the past and bring details and ideas to the present in a new and exciting way,” said McFadden, who is executive director, CAD Product Management, with Gerber.\nThe process of converting these garments to a computer generated dress for a 3D avatar yields astonishing results. Being vintage and highly constructed, some with corsets, yards of fabric and even boning, the dresses that McFadden 3D-rendered were a challenge.\nWith these garments being older and fragile, there were unique steps taken. 3D rendering vintage garments requires attention to lots of small and specialized details in order to make sure that fabric is as flowing and life-like in the digital world, as it is in person.\n“I knew that this would be an extraordinary project, and Mary rose to the occasion and completely surpassed even my highest expectations. To be able to collaborate and further extend the Darnell Collection’s role as a large design resource was amazing,” said Smith.\nUsing AccuMark® Silhouette™, McFadden was able to actually trace the finished garments using an advanced stylus. After drawing lines around the entire piece in detail and connecting many dots, she took pictures of the original fabric and used these as fill to reproduce the details in the fabric on the computer. McFadden then pulled the piece up on the AccuMark screen and fit the garment to an avatar, allowing us to see the dress in 3D through this state-of-the-art simulation system.\nThis year, Gerber Technology’s ideation2015 recognizes The Darnell Collection, a tribute to classic fashion, as it hosts a design competition for college students studying fashion design, with the theme, “Everything has changed, but one thing hasn’t.” Working with dresses spanning the course of five decades, students were asked to submit garments inspired by any elements of the original dresses. There will be a fashion show at ideation2015 (Oct. 29-30) in which the finalists will show their creations, many of them newly 3D-rendered by Mary McFadden.

{"best_of": 1, "echo": true, "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 0, "model": "opt-1.5b", "n": 1, "prompt": "InterSolar U.S. (Part I): What was of interest to start-ups in Ontario?\nNot quite the size of its big brother in Munich (58,000 visitors), the InterSolar U.S. in San Francisco was nevertheless one of the largest solar industry conferences in North America to date with 17,000 visitors from July 13-16. As such, it is a useful place to gauge industry sentiment, not at least because the conference came just weeks after the Obama administration’s ACESA bill (a.k.a. The Waxman-Markey Bill) passed congress, albeit narrowly.\nDespite many solar technology companies losing 75-80% of their market cap over the last 12 months, there was a quiet confidence among the leading players in the industry on display in San Francisco. The main reason for this confidence is that the long-term growth prospects for the industry are promising.\nAnalyst Travis Bedford of The Prometheus Institute predicted that the U.S. solar market will triple in size by 2012 and that photovoltaic (PV) technology will reach grid parity for 95% of the U.S. population by 2015. By Bedford’s own admittance, these predictions were based on very conservative assumptions, meaning that they might even come through sooner if conditions change in a positive direction.\nSolar markets around the world largely depend on government regulations and incentive schemes. I have previously described the successful German legislation for renewable energy, EEG, upon which many other countries have modeled their own legislation, including Spain, Italy, France, Greece and in Canada, Ontario, with its Green Energy Act. The U.S. market is different – the feed-in tariff scheme that has been so successful in Germany is perceived by many in the U.S. as a subsidy and thus politically unpalatable – and policies tend therefore to focus mainly on tax credits and quota arrangements to create incentives for utilities and investors alike to invest in renewable energy generation.\nDespite that, there are examples of both states and local utility companies that use FIT schemes to stimulate private investments in renewable energy technology (i.e. California, Vermont, Gainesville, FL and Sacramento, CA).\nThink the U.S. is one big market?\nWith every state, municipality and utility company creating their own mix of legislation and incentives, the U.S. market can hardly be seen as one single market, as pointed out to me by Alfonso Velosa III, a Research Director with analyst firm Gartner Inc. When all the different regulations at the various levels of government are taken into consideration, the U.S. has around 750 different markets. Nevertheless, there are strong indications that the various levels of government in many states are working to introduce more favorable regulation to stimulate investment in renewable energy. As with Ontario, it is the job creation potential of the industry that is driving politicians this way, with the added benefit of lowering carbon emissions and reducing dependency on coal, (imported) oil and gas.\nFrom a technology perspective, the industry believes that 2009 will be a watershed year in many ways. Primarily on account of the global credit crunch – which has made the finance industry more conservative in their approach – emerging solar technologies have had a particularly rough year because they are not seen as “bankable” or “financable”. The lack of performance track records for technologies like thin film and concentrated PV (CPV) has meant that it has not been possible to obtain project financing for those technologies, although the picture is not entirely uniform across the world. While European banks at one point explicitly declined to finance thin film projects, both thin film and CPV have achieved financing in the U.S., with thin film clearly the more successful of the two due to its greater maturity. Both thin film and CPV must improve, however, to gain credibility both in North America and elsewhere. Thin film must improve both durability and conversion efficiency from today’s 7-8% level to above 10%. CPV must both lower cost, rid itself of potential heat problems and demonstrate reliability along the way.\nFor many solar start-ups this is too much to ask and they will fail in 2009 because their technology lacks “financability”, which also reduces their ability to attract growth capital in today’s risk-averse climate. This is unfortunate, as the solar industry need speculative money in order to reach breakthrough innovations that can make the industry sustainable globally without relying on government incentives.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

Although producers from this area only make traditional Cabernet Sauvignon-based blends, there’s still plenty of diversity of flavor in these wines, making the tasting experience very exciting. If you want to start your own Pauillac wine collection from scratch or you’re looking for new wines to add to an already extensive collection, then this guide will help you discover the best wines that this region has to offer.\nWhat Are Château d’Yquem’s Best Vintages?\nWhat makes a great Château d’Yquem vintage? All of these wines are excellent–the château doesn’t release a vintage if the grapes aren’t satisfactory–and they’re all designed to age for decades, so there aren’t many vintages that fall short. Still, different vintages have different strengths. You’ll find vintages that taste mature just 35 years after release and others that still taste exceptionally young at age 50. Some collectors prefer Château d’Yquem bottles that develop mature flavors fairly early whereas others prefer wines that age more slowly. This guide will help you find the best Château d’Yquem vintages based on your personal preferences and goals.\nUsually, winemakers in Bordeaux are hesitant to call a vintage superb until all of the grapes have been picked and the wine has finished fermenting. This year, however, winemakers across the region are thrilled with the quality and ripeness of the grapes–they’re already calling the 2018 Bordeaux harvest one of the most successful of the past decade. While it’s still too early to make any definitive predictions about the investment potential of the 2018 vintage, based on the health of the grapes picked so far, you can expect to see plenty of age-worthy, intense wines. This is a vintage that you’ll want to keep a close watch on as it develops over the next few months.\nLeft Bank vs. Right Bank Bordeaux: Which Should You Invest In?\nBefore you invest in Left Bank or Right Bank wines, you’ll want to understand their key differences. For example, while both banks make age-worthy, collectible wines, the Left Bank tends to make wines with better aging potential overall compared to most wines from the Right Bank. This is why many collectors perceive the Left Bank to be more collectible; the Left Bank is also home to all five of Bordeaux’s First Growth producers. However, when it comes to Left Bank vs. Right Bank Bordeaux, the differences go beyond collectibility.\nIn Bordeaux, there are vintages that seem destined for success from the start—and then there are the “sleeper vintages,” the wines that hide their true power for a decade or more. The 2006 Bordeaux vintage is one of these rare sleepers. While it was overshadowed by the legendary 2005 vintage in its youth, today, the best 2006 Bordeaux is rich, intensely concentrated, and an absolute joy to drink. These qualities, coupled with the wine’s potential for aging, make it the perfect gift for wine collectors on your holiday list this year. In order to take advantage of all that this vintage has to offer, you’ll need to consider which appellations had the most success, and choose the wines with the greatest potential for aging.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}

It is supplied to homes and industries through pipelines every day and transported to millions of consumers. The gas supply either comes from domestic gas well production, withdrawals from storage facilities or imports. Natural gas supply fulfills the demands of customers during the summers and even excess natural gas is produced which is stored in the facilities. During winters, the demand for natural gas exceeds the supply and so, the withdrawal from storage fulfills the demand.\nUsually, the cost of the gas itself is even lesser than half of the price paid by the residential and commercial customers. The cost transmission and distribution is fixed, regardless of the consumption. So, sometimes it may happen that even though the demand for gas declines but the cost per unit gas increases. That’s why sometimes, in the summers, a total natural gas bill is usually less but the cost of gas per unit is high. This is to account for the overall expenditure incurred for the supply of the gas. If the demand level is higher than the production level, this also causes an increase in the rate of natural gas.\nProduction difficulties may cause reduced supply (e.g. breakdown of equipment, a fault in machinery).\nuring the past years, the natural gas prices are fluctuating too rapidly. The impact of these fluctuations on the customers varies according to the needs. The prices of residential customers are more stable than those of industrial users. That is because residential customers pay a bill every month and see quite less variation because prices don’t vary as much as daily. On the other hand, electric utilities and large consumers, who have short-term contracts without fixed prices, suffer the most due to price fluctuations. These customers make such arrangements because in this way they can switch to other fuels for cost savings.\nDuring the past years, there has been a decline in the natural gas prices. There are various reasons including the increased competition and efficiency because of the regulatory restructuring of the gas industry. Another reason is the pressure due to the competitive prices of the lower petroleum products. The innovation in the gas industry and pipeline system, and the improved technology has also helped to increase the production and manage the natural gas prices.

These structures provide a multiplicity of contact points with the substrate upon which the spider passes; so much so, in fact, as to create a natural adhesion between the spider and the substrate. The result is that spiders possessing dense pads of scopulae are, in general, able to scale smooth vertical surfaces–including glass–with ease.\nThe faculty afforded by these structures is remarkable. One spider biologist (Foelix, 1996, pp. 18-19) points out that, under experimental conditions, spiders in the genus Cupiennius (mygalomorph hunting spiders in the Ctenidae family, native to the tropical rain forests of Central and South America) were able to hold ten times their body weight without slipping, while sitting on a vertical plate of glass. However, Foelix adds that each scopula hair splits into thousands of even finer cuticular extensions, so that–for example–a crab spider with but 30 scopula hairs on each foot is able to achieve 160,000 microscopic contact points between its feet and the substrate it passes over. The resulting adhesion, says Foelix, is not due to suction or electrostatic forces, but results from sheer physical adhesion, enhanced by the capillary forces provided from a micro-thin film of water. Absent the latter water film, the scopulae fail to adhere to smooth surfaces, and the spider loses the climbing faculties the scopulae otherwise supply.\nFoelix, Rainer F. 1996.

The applicants, the Institute for Community Living, proposed the a zoning map and zoning text amendment at the site, located on the southwest corner of the intersection of Nevins Street and Schermerhorn Street in the Downtown Brooklyn neighborhood.\nIn 1986, the Institute appropriated the building to establish its “Stepping Stone Treatment Residence” for single adults with serious mental illness.

Kalau tak de, dia semua kembang, ubi kentang kembang.\"\nThe menu isn't exceptionally extensive, but it hits many essentials. \"Kita baru, jadi tak berani bikin banyak-banyak barang,\" says Uncle Wee. You'll find otak-otak (RM12+), telur cincalok (RM15+), terung goreng (RM12+) & udang masak lemak nanas (RM35+), capably prepared & enjoyably tasty, alongside other highlights like itik tim, kari dabael, rendang daging lembu, sambal petai sotong & ikan asam pedas. Portions seem suitable for two to three people; a meal here may exceed RM30 per person, particularly if you order prawns, but there are lunch sets that cost a more budget-friendly RM12.90-RM18.90 each.\nA very interesting and pleasant, bright colour scheme! I love it when places are not afraid to use colour! The dishes look very nice, too!\nThis is one place I gotta check out - love the rustic decor... and loveeeee Nyonya food as well!\nWee? Hmmm...not related to me, I'm sure. Baba nyonya...count me in! Drooling! Drooling!!! Hope to check out this place sometime.\nOOhh we just had peranakan food here in Sydney last week too! Dishes looked really familiar.. ahh love the pongteh with rice!\nHooray! Another new restaurant here, hehe.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": null, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1}
